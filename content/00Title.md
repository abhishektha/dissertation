thesisabstract: |
  Current gas-pressurized spacesuit designs have a history of inducing contact and musculoskeletal injuries during ground-based training exercises and microgravity operations. 
  These injuries are hypothesized to be caused by the suits' stiff pressurized design, poor indexing between the suit and the operator, and poor sizing of the suit to the operator. 
  This is especially prevalent in the spacesuit boot; spacesuit operators have reported heel-lift in current planetary spacesuit boot prototypes, where there the foot inside the boot lifts before the boot responds.
  This work in this thesis therefore focused on investigating whether dynamic foot shape models can be used to improve spacesuit boot design with increased comfort and heel performance.  

  Heel-lift in the spacesuit boot has not been previously quantified.
  The first aim of this thesis evaluated the use of inertial measurement units (IMUs) and drift-correction techniques in quantifying the magnitude and frequency of heel-lift. 
  These techniques were able to estimate occurrences of heel-lift, but did not quantify magnitude at the desired precision. 
  Results also suggested spacesuit lower leg expansion prior to heel-off in one subject, which may be an indication of tighter boot fit. 
  These results suggest that IMUs alone may not be sufficient for heel-lift characterization. 

  The foot's dynamic morphology during walking was characterized in this work's second aim in order to explore its utility in spacesuit boot design. 
  A custom 4D capture system was developed to capture foot scan data from 30 subjects as they walked on a treadmill.
  This data was represented in a parametric statistical shape model, able to predict dynamic foot shape with an accuracy of 5.2 $\pm$ 2 mm. 
  The analysis identified shape changes at the instep and heel as targets for reducing heel-lift through boot design. 
  A further analysis found no correlation between dynamic instep height and static foot anthropometries, suggesting that footwear should have adjustment for individual differences. 

  A framework was constructed to integrate the dynamic foot shape model into the footwear design process in this work's third aim. 
  A novel spacesuit boot was designed with a focus on lacing to accommodate instep height variability, and a heel counter to secure the heel during shape changes. 
  A prototype spacesuit boot was then constructed to allow for evaluation of this design against current planetary spacesuit boot technology. 

  This work's final aim evaluated the novel spacesuit boot for its heel performance and comfort against a work boot and a current spacesuit boot. 
  Five subjects performed heel raises and a short walk in the boots. 
  Results from quantitative measurements and surveys found the novel spacesuit boot was found to maintain contact during the heel-off like the laced work boot, but continue to maintain some contact at the maximum heel-rise. 
  Bayesian linear regression modeling showed that in all heel performance  measurements, the novel spacesuit boot was estimated to perform better 100% of the time compared to classic spacesuit boot technology. 
  These results show that designing a spacesuit boot using dynamic body shape models allows for a better fitting and more compatible boot, which reduces the risk of factors which lead to spacesuit injury
