# Motivation {#chapter:motiv}

The Apollo missions represent the last time humans set foot on another planetary surface, the Moon. 
Future human spaceflight missions are retargeting planetary surface exploration by sending astronauts back to the Moon and onward to Mars.
While robotic missions can perform many of the scientific aspects of planetary exploration, human exploration still plays a key role in planetary mission success [@Drake2010].

Spacesuits are designed to both provide life support and help protect the astronaut during activities conduced outside a space habitat, known as extravehicular activity (EVA).
EVA is an important consideration of planetary exploration, allowing astronauts to perform scientific experiments, collect geological samples, perform habitat maintanence, and construct infrastructure.
During EVA, astronauts are subject to many physiological and environment factors, including reduced gravity loading, dust, radiation, and extreme environment temperatures.
In addition, the lack of atmosphere does not provide life support.
Therefore, an EVA spacesuit's primary design objectives are to protect its operator from the environment and allow them to perform EVA tasks. 

Humankind's current planetary EVA experience is limited to a total of 78 hours over 6 Apollo surface  missions [@Portree1997].
During the Apollo missions, astronauts performed almost 10 hours of EVA in a 24 hour period without the assistance of a rover during Apollo 14, and 22 hours of EVA in a 36-hour period with the assistance of a rover during Apollo 17 [@Portree1997].
The longest traverse performed on the lunar surface occurred during Apollo 12, where astronauts Charles Conrad and Alan Bean walked 1.8 km [@Portree1997].
Apollo 15-17 missions involving a rover assumed astronauts would be able to walk 5 km in case of rover failure [@Portree1997], but this requirement is doubled for future missions. 
Future planetary mission design assumes astronauts can walk up to 10 kilometers to return
to their habitat, and that astronauts can perform 8-hour EVAs, with a limit of 12 hours of EVA per 24 hours and 24 hours of EVA per 7 days [@Drake2010].
In addition, NASA's current planetary exploration plans focus on extended stays and colonization, increasing surface mission time and therefore increasing total EVA time. 
Future planetary EVA missions will therefore need a spacesuit that comfortably protects astronauts while they perform EVA tasks and traverse across the surface on these long duration missions.

## EMU Spacesuit Injury Incidence

Following the Apollo era, space missions have all occurred in low Earth orbit in a microgravity environment. 
New spacesuits, such as the Extra-Vehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) were designed for microgravity operations.
This included greater upper-torso mobility while reducing lower-torso mobility, as astronauts would be floating in space and not be required to ambulate. 
However, the increase in EVA activities that accompanied the construction of the International Space Station have resulted in a number of crew injuries, prompting studies into the human-spacesuit interactions and deficiencies in suit design that lead to these injuries. 

Crewmember difficulties with the spacesuit have existed since the first EVA, where Alexi Leonov had difficulties moving the suit to re-enter the spacecraft. 
Apollo astronauts have commented on the fatiguing reduced mobility of their spacesuits [@Scheuring2008].
Gas pressurized spacesuits are known to be inherently stiff and rigid [@Parry1966;@Abramov1994;@Schmidt2001a;@Holschuh2009], difficult to move [@Norcross2009;@Amick2015], and have the potential to cause injuries both during operations and ground-based training [@Williams2003;@Strauss2004;@Scheuring2008;@Scheuring2009;@Chappell2017].

The prevalence of injury has been well studied in the era of on-orbit microgravity EVAs performed with the EMU. 
Strauss [@Strauss2004] found that 24.6% of training sessions at the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) between 2004 to 2006 study had reported injury symptoms. 
Viegas [@Viegas2004] found a 67.5% reporting rate of injury symptoms from astronauts training in the NBL between 2002 to 2003. 
An in-flight injury incidence of 0.24 was reported by Scheuring [@Scheuring2012] for EVAs occurring on Space Shuttle flights 90 to 113. 
These injuries can be classified as contact injuries, including bruises and abrasions; and musculoskeletal injuries, including muscle tears, strains, and inflammation.

### Spacesuit Contact Injuries
Spacesuit contact injuries have been the most reported operational injury mechanism in the US space program [@Scheuring2008], and in the EMU  [@Strauss2004; @Viegas2004; @Scheuring2012]. 
Contact injuries occur through repeated contact between the wearer and the spacesuit. 
High contact pressure between the wearer and spacesuit can lead to bruises, while shear can lead to abrasions [@Mailler2004;@Carlson2006].

EVA hand injuries have been reported since the Apollo era, with symptoms including swollen and abraded joints, putting the mission at risk [@Scheuring2012]. 
Hand injuries continue to be most frequently reported injury in the EMU [@Strauss2004; @Viegas2004; @Scheuring2012].
Hand contact injuries include fingernail delamination, abrasions, contusions, and nerve impingement [@Strauss2004; @Viegas2004; @Scheuring2012]. 
These injuries have widely been attributed to the poor fit and unprotected contacts between the hand and the spacesuit glove [@Strauss2004; @Viegas2004]. 

Shoulder contact injuries occur from the combination of unprotected contact and high weight loading in the EMU [@Strauss2004;@Viegas2004]. 
Shoulder injuries are reported as the second most common EMU injury location and frequently occur during ground-based training in the NBL, when the wearer may be inverted in the suit [@Strauss2004;@Viegas2004]. 
While the wearer is neutrally buoyant, they are still under the effects of gravity. 
Therefore, they "fall" into the suit, and are now making contact with the hard upper torso (HUT). 
Therefore, the increased contact and high levels of load leads to shoulder contact injuries.

The feet are the next most reported areas of in-flight EMU contact injuries in the spacesuit [@Scheuring2012]. 
Traditionally, not much motion occurs in the lower torso of the EMU spacesuit due to its design targeting microgravity operations. 
The feet are normally restrained in a fixed foot restraint, while the astronaut performs tasks utilizing their upper body. 
One astronaut reported a "searing, knife-like pain" on their foot during on-orbit EVA which was unable to be rectified [@Scheuring2012].
This resulted in a blister and decreased sensation on the foot's dorsal surface, and was later attributed to having excess pressure bladder material in the boot [@Scheuring2012]. 
Strauss [@Strauss2004] also reports contact injuries on the toes and dorsal surface stemming from the boot sizing insert, which does not adequately project the astronaut from contact from the foot restraint or bladder folds. 

Other reported locations for EMU contact injuries include the elbow, knee, and trunk [@Strauss2004;@Scheuring2012]. 
Injuries at wearer's elbows and knees are reported to come from rubbing against the convolute joints [@Strauss2004]. 
Injuries at the trunk are reported to occur from contact between the wearer's back and the Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment (LCVG) in the spacesuit [@Strauss2004]. 

### Spacesuit Musculoskeletal Injuries

Fatigue from high exertion may lead to musculoskeletal injuries
EMU Musculoskeletal injuries have been reported in the hands, due to the high exertion needed to actuate fingers on the pressurized glove [@Viegas2004].
Fatigue may occur after many hours of completing EVA tasks [@Strauss2004;@Scheuring2012].
Similarly, the elbow joints in the EMU have also reportedly caused strains [@Strauss2004].

Limitations of the EMU suit design can also lead to musculoskeletal injuries, the most severe which occurred at the shoulder [@Strauss2004]. 
EMU operators can overuse their rotator cuff during EVA tasks, leading to muscle strains, sprains, tears, and overuse injuries [@Williams2003;@Strauss2004; @Strauss2005; @Scheuring2012].
Some of these injuries have required surgical intervention [@Strauss2005]. 

## Hypothesized Spacesuit Injury Mechanisms

Limitations in suit joint design and the poor fit between the suit and its operator can both lead to contact or musculoskeletal injuries. 
While other environmental factors, such as increased humidity, were also found to have a role in EMU fingernail de-lamination [@Chappell2017], this section will focus on the design and fit factors for spacesuits. 
High exertion needed to actuate joints and poor indexing can lead to excessive musculoskeletal injuries, while poor sizing and poor indexing can lead to contact injuries, increasing the risk of injury [@fig:B-fitflow]. 

![Overview of how deficiencies in spacesuit design and fit can lead to increased injury risk](../fig/Background/fitflow.PNG){#fig:B-fitflow width="60%"}

Pressurized spacesuit joints require more energy to move than compared to unsuited motions [@Newman1997; @Amick2015].
While design features aim to reduce the effort needed to bend joints [@Harris2001], these joints are difficult to engineer in areas such as the hand. 
Therefore, the fatigue and strain injuries reported in the hand could be due to inherent design deficiencies of EMU spacesuit gloves [@Strauss2004;@Viegas2004].

Spacesuit joints also need to be properly aligned to the wearer to reduce both contact and musculoskeletal injury risk. 
Indexing is a specific fit measurement regarding the alignment of the operator's joints to the spacesuit's joints.
Poor indexing can lead to contact injuries when joint centers drift out of alignment and cause rubbing against the suit during motion, as seen in the elbow and knee of the EMU [@Strauss2004]
Deficiencies in suit design, including the high exertion to actuate joints and range-of-motion limitations, can also cause poor indexing and lead to injury.
Viegas reports a specific mechanism in the EMU glove where the high exertion required to actuate the glove results in dorsal displacement of the metacarpophalangeal joints, pushing the tops of fingers against the surface of the glove and causing inflammation [@Viegas2004].
Poor indexing at the the EMU HUT design forces internal rotation of the shoulder due to the scye opening not allowing for full range-of-motion of the shoulders, leading to potential overuse and injury of the rotator cuff muscle [@Williams2003;@Strauss2004; @Strauss2005; @Scheuring2012].
Suit joints should therefore be designed and sized to ensure proper indexing.

Suit components also need to be properly sized to the operator to reduce contact injury risk. 
Sizing, along with indexing, ensures that the suit is fit to the operator. 
Spacesuits in the Apollo era were custom tailored to each astronaut. 
However, as the astronaut corp grew, the EMU presented a modular sizing system, where differently-sized suit components had to be selected for each astronaut. 
Gaps between the wearer and the spacesuit could lead to excessive contact when the wearer moves and shifts inside the spacesuit [@Benson2009]. 
Suit components which are too small can also cause higher contact pressures, leading to potential contact injuries. 
Poorly sized bladder inserts were found to be a factor in EMU foot injuries [@Strauss2004]. Opperman et al [@Opperman2010] found that higher hand circumferences have a larger incidence of fingernail delamination in the spacesuit glove, while Charvat et al [@Charvat2015] found smaller hand circumferences to be a risk factor in fingernail delamination, showing how sensitive fit is in leading to injury. 
Suit components should therefore be sized accurately to the suit's operator to ensure proper fit. 

## Spacesuit Injury Countermeasures

Attempts to mitigate spacesuit injury have focused on addressing the fit and mobility limitations of the EMU. 
Newer spacesuit prototypes feature larger scye openings for better indexing and more mobile shoulder bearings compared to the EMU [@Graziosi2016]. 
However, testing of microgravity EVA task performance in the NBL found that while the new design allowed for more shoulder compatibility, larger subjects still reported discomfort in the shoulder area [@Meginnis2018].
This shows how  sizing and indexing are just as important as spacesuit mobility to ensure a properly compatible spacesuit. 
It still remains impossible to perfectly fit every person to the EMU spacesuit due to the wide ranges of anthropometry and limited sizing components [@Benson2009]. 
Back padding on the EMU was found to potentially assist wearers in controlling the upper torso of the suit, reduce over-rotation of the torso to keep upper extremity joints aligned, and improve indexing at the gloves [@Chappell2017]. 
For wearers with a smaller anthropometry however, indexing at the hip bearings was unable to be fixed by padding, due to the limitations in torso length.
In addition, effects of indexing on performance are inconclusive [@Fineman2018].
Therefore, there is a need to improve spacesuit sizing and indexing to work with any improvements in spacesuit mobility to reduce the risk of contact and musculoskeletal injuries. 

## Summary
The push towards planetary exploration requires advancements in spacesuit design to create a safe and comfortable environment for astronauts to perform EVAs.
Our planetary exploration experience is limited to just 6 Apollo missions to the Moon as missions have shifted towards microgravity research, but future plans call for an extended human presence on the Moon and Mars. 
Microgravity EVAs and training have resulted in many upper torso injuries due to hard-to-move joints and poorly fitted suits.
The transition to planetary EVAs, with a focus on ambulation, may result in a higher incidence rate of injuries in the lower torso without significant changes in the way spacesuits are designed and fitted. 
Therefore, it is important to understand how operator-spacesuit interactions and spacesuit performance may lead to injury in the context of planetary tasks such as ambulating as planetary surface missions are planned.
This will allow for the construction of safer and more comfortable spacesuits to reduce the risk of injuries during EVA.
