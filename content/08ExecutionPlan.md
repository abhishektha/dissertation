Through many advancements of planetary EVA spacesuit design, operator-spacesuit coordination is still not perfectly matched. 
Poor mobility and poor fit between the operator and spacesuit are some of the most common factors that can lead to injury.
This thesis aims to determine the feasibility of using dynamic body shape models to improve spacesuit component fit and mobility, specifically with planetary spacesuit boots.
The spacesuit boot has demonstrated specific problems relating to poor fit, such as heel-lift and contact injuries. 
The work in the thesis aims to answer the hypothesis:

> Integrating dynamic body shape changes into the spacesuit boot design process will mitigate factors that lead to injury and improve compatibility between the operator and the spacesuit.

## Academic Requirements

All required coursework was completed as of the Spring 2020 semester. Of the 36 required credits, 30 were taken in ASEN, with 12 at the 6000 level. MCEN 5228 (Modeling Human Movement) and APPM 5590 (Statistical Modeling) were taken outside of ASEN. The 6 required math credits were exceeded with taking ASEN 5519 (Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis), APPM 5590 (Statistical Modeling), and ASEN 5044 (Statistical Estimation for Dynamical Systems). As of the Fall 2020 semester, 15 out of the 30 required Doctoral dissertation credits have been taken. The remaining 15 credits will be evenly taken during the Spring 2021, Fall 2021, and Spring 2022 semesters. The teaching practicum has been fulfilled through the mentoring of UROP students in the Summer 2018, Fall 2019, and Spring 2020 semesters. A  TA position is also expected in Fall 2021.
