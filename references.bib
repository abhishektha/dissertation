abstract = {Spacewalkers enjoy a view of Earth once reserved for Apollo, Zeus, and other denizens of Mt. Olympus. During humanity's first extravehicular activity (EVA), Alexei Leonov floated above Gibraltar, the rock ancient seafarers saw as the gateway to the great unknown Atlantic. The symbol-ism was clear - Leonov stepped past a new Gibraltar when he stepped into space. More than 32 years and 154 EVAs later, Jerry Linenger conducted an EVA with Vladimir Tsibliyev as part of International Space Station Phase I. They floated together above Gibraltar. Today the symbolism has new meaning - humanity is starting to think of stepping out of Earth orbit, space travel's new Gibraltar, and perhaps obtaining a new olympian view - a close-up look at Olympus Mons on Mars. Walking to Olympus: An EVA Chronology chronicles the 154 EVAs conducted from March 1965 to April 1997. It is intended to make clear the crucial role played by EVA in the history of spaceflight, as well as to chronicle the large body of EVA "lessons learned." Russia and the U.S. define EVA differently. Russian cosmonauts are said to perform EVA any time they are in vacuum in a space suit. A U.S. astronaut must have at least his head outside his spacecraft before he is said to perform an EVA. The difference is based in differing spacecraft design philosophies. Russian and Soviet spacecraft have always had a specialized airlock through which the EVA cosmonaut egressed, leaving the main habitable volume of the spacecraft pressurized. The U.S. Gemini and Apollo vehicles, on the other hand, depressurized their entire habitable volume foregress. In this document, we apply the Russian definition to Russian EVAs, and the U.S. definition to U.S.EVAs. Thus, for example, Gemini 4 Command Pilot James McDivitt does not share the honor of being first American spacewalker with Ed White, even though he was suited and in vacuum when White stepped out into space. Non-EVA spaceflights are listed in the chronology to provide context and to display the large number of flights in which EVA played a role. This approach also makes apparent significant EVA gaps -for example, the U.S. gap between 1985 and 1991 following the Challenger accident.},

@article{Scheuring2008,
abstract = {Introduction: Medical requirements for the future crew exploration vehicle (CEV), lunar surface access module (LSAM), advanced extravehicular activity (EVA) suits, and Lunar habitat are currently being developed within the exploration architecture. While much is known about the vehicle and lunar surface activities during Apollo, relatively little is known about whether the hardware, systems, or environment impacted crew health or performance during these missions. Also, inherent to the proposed aggressive surface activities is the potential risk of injury to crewmembers. The Space Medicine Division at the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) requested a study in December 2005 to identify Apollo mission issues relevant to medical operations impacting crew health and/or performance during a lunar mission. The goals of this project were to develop or modify medical requirements for new vehicles and habitats, create a centralized database for future access, and share relevant Apollo information with various working groups participating in the exploration effort. Methods: A review of medical operations during Apollo missions 7-17 was conducted. Ten categories of hardware, systems, or crew factors were identified during preliminary data review generating 655 data records which were captured in an Access{\textregistered} database. The preliminary review resulted in 285 questions. The questions were posed to surviving Apollo crewmembers using mail, face-to-face meetings, phone communications, or online interactions. Results: Fourteen of 22 surviving Apollo astronauts (64{\%}) participated in the project. This effort yielded 107 recommendations for future vehicles, habitats, EVA suits, and lunar surface operations. Conclusions: To date, the Apollo Medical Operations recommendations are being incorporated into the exploration mission architecture at various levels and a centralized database has been developed. The Apollo crewmember's input has proved to be an invaluable resource. We will continue soliciting input from this group as we continue to evolve and refine requirements for the future exploration missions.},

@inproceedings{Abramov1994,
abstract = {The operating pressure value is one of the principal considerations for trade-off analysis of the space suit enclosure and the individual life support subsystem (LSS). From the physiological point of view, the same level of pressure in the suit and space vehicle reflects the best solution. Current Russian space vehicles and orbiting stations use the Earth atmosphere. A suit operating pressure at such a level would result in complicated and technically unreasonable designs. Improved mobility of the pressurized suit and enhanced performance characteristics of the LSS can be offered with the minimized positive pressure. However, the minimized suit pressure concept leads to the increased risk of crewmember decompression sickness. Therefore, the suit operating pressure selection calls for a trade-off of physiological tolerances of the crewmember versus technical feasibility of this or that solution as principal considerations. The paper reviews the effect of the suit operating pressure on certain technical characteristics of a space suit, in particular, mobility, amount of oxygen available to compensate for leakage, mass and strength as well as on metabolic rate. The paper reviews also physiological criteria which affect the selection of the suit operating pressure. Based on the presented information, recommendations are given as to the trade selection of the suit operating pressure. {\textcopyright} Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.},

abstract = {Gas-pressurized space suits are highly resistive to astronaut movement, and this resistance has been previously explained by volume and/or structural effects. This study proposed that an additional effect, pressure effects due to compressing/expanding the internal gas during joint articulation, also inhibits mobility. EMU elbow torque components were quantified through hypobaric testing. Structural effects dominated at low joint angles, and volume effects were found to be the primary torque component at higher angles. Pressure effects were found to be significant only at high joint angles (increased flexion), contributing up to 8.8{\%} of the total torque. These effects are predicted to increase for larger, multi-axis joints. An active regulator system was developed to mitigate pressure effects, and was found to be capable of mitigating repeated pressure spikes caused by volume changes.

@techreport{Norcross2009,
abstract = {The primary objective of this study was to collect human performance data and produce a crew consensus regarding the feasibility of performing a suited 10-km walkback. All subjects completed the 10-km walkback in less than 2 hours and completed the test with little difficulty working at about 50{\%} of their aerobic exercise capacity. A secondary objective of the study was to understand the specific human performance limitations of the suit compared to matched unsuited controls. Preliminary analysis indicated that the metabolic cost of the suit was significant ({\textgreater} 3.5 ml•min-1•kg-1) compared to unsuited controls. Weight-matched unsuited trials provided an initial estimate accounting for the metabolic cost of the suit due to the increased weight of the suit. But additional factors such as inertial mass, center of gravity (CG) alterations, pressure-volume work, and suit kinematic constraints could not be isolated. Additional tests will be needed to evaluate these other suit related factors. Results of this test also clearly indicated that crew members in the MKIII suit may perform well on the moon but may not perform well on Mars due to the increased gravity. In the lunar trials, the suited metabolic rates were all submaximal, whereas in the Mars-suited trials, subjects rapidly approached near maximal physiologic effort while brisk walking. Proving human performance and suit biomechanical data for use in the suit and portable life support system (PLSS) design was another secondary objective. Baseline ambulation metabolic rates will allow for understanding of PLSS needs depending on the amount of ambulation expected in the lunar operational concepts. Oxygen transport cost values indicated that optimum efficiency was achieved at faster speeds for lunar-suited ambulation, but current cooling capabilities of the Shuttle extravehicular activity (EVA) suit and Apollo suits would be insufficient to take advantage of this improved efficiency. Additional considerations from this test include the development and refinement of data analysis methods that will form a set of ”standard measures” for future studies that look at effects of suit weight, mass, pressure, CG, and kinematic constraints for both ambulation and exploration tasks. Tools resulting from the EVA Walkback Test include analysis software to rapidly post-process motion data to determine the number of cycles on any joint of the suit as a function of time and velocity, and to provide a quantitative index of stability. These analysis tools will be effective for developing suit cycle requirements and will provide significant cost savings during suit certification compared to the conventional methods of manual video tape review. Finally, there were limitations to this study. Only 6 male astronauts participated in this study. The test team was unable to determine to what extent the POGO, unsuited harness and suited gimbal system affected performance from the limited data set. However, these data provide a critical step forward to understanding and quantifying suited human performance in reduced gravity. Future studies using different subjects, EVA suits, harnessing/gimbal systems, analog environments, and different tasks will be needed to foster a thorough understanding of how human performance is affected by EVA suits and reduced gravity environments.},

Differences of practical significant were observed between suit conditions for mean peak elbow flexion and extension, but not for shoulder abduction/adduction. EMU resistance to movement was found to differ based on the direction of movement. Discussion: Characteristics of the EMU spacesuit may reduce performance for some movements and improve performance for others.},

abstract = {Introduction: Astronauts have sustained musculoskeletal injuries and minor trauma in space, but our knowledge of these injuries is based mainly on anecdotal reports. The purpose of our study was to catalog and analyze all in-flight musculoskeletal injuries occurring throughout the U.S. space program to date. Methods: A database on in-flight musculoskeletal injuries among U.S. astronauts was generated from records at the Johnson Space Center. Results: A total of 219 in-flight musculoskeletal injuries were identified, 198 occurring in men and 21 in women. Incidence over the course of the space program was 0.021 per flight day for men and 0.015 for women. Hand injuries represented the most common location of injuries, with abrasions and small lacerations representing common manifestations of these injuries. Crew activity in the spacecraft cabin such as translating between modules, aerobic and resistive exercise, and injuries caused by the extravehicular activity (EVA) suit components were the leading causes of musculoskeletal injuries. Exercise-related injuries accounted for an incidence of 0.003 per day and exercise is the most frequent source of injuries in astronauts living aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Interaction with EVA suit components accounted for an incidence of 0.26 injuries per EVA. Discussion: Hand injuries were among the most common events occurring in U.S. astronauts during spaceflight. Identifying the incidence and mechanism of in-flight injuries will allow flight surgeons to quantify the amount of medical supplies needed in the design of next-generation spacecraft. Engineers can use in-flight injury data to further refine the EVA suit and vehicle components. Copyright {\textcopyright} by the Aerospace Medical Association.},

abstract = {Reddened painful skin, areas where the outermost layer of skin has been rubbed off (abrasions), and blisters are very common problems observed daily by orthotists, prosthetists, pedorthists, athletic trainers, and a host of other caregivers. These examples of acute skin trauma and the pain that precedes and/or accompanies them are often what determine the limits of an individual's functional performance. When these problems occur within footwear, orthoses, or prosthetic sockets, the cause is repetitive loading-a combination of peak load magnitude and number of loading cycles sufficient to produce significant skin trauma. Walking, running, and many other activities involve movements of skeletal elements relative to surfaces such as shoe insoles, orthoses, and prosthetic sockets. Those relative movements are an inevitable consequence of transferring load through soft tissue and across the skin interface. The loads contain both normal (perpendicular to the skin surface) components and friction (parallel to the skin surface) components. Historically, most instances of skin trauma have been attributed directly to excess pressure and have been dealt with using pressure-management techniques exclusively. Pressure-reduction techniques do often lead to some improvement. However, the assumption that those problems are directly governed by excess pressure is substantially in error, leading to partial solutions and missed opportunities to achieve much higher levels of safe, pain-free function. Research has established the friction component of repetitive loadings to be the major factor governing how many load cycles a given area of skin can tolerate before the onset of pain and acute trauma. To increase comfortable, pain-free function, the magnitude of friction load peaks applied each loading cycle must be reduced. This can be accomplished by reducing peak normal (pressure) load magnitudes and/or reducing the coefficient of friction (COF) operating between the skin and support surface in the problem area. Friction forces over the vast majority of the loaded skin surface area are useful for stability, suspension, and the transmission of functional forces. Friction creates a problem only in very limited areas. This is the rationale for reducing the operative COF in problem areas only. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Academy of Orthotists {\&} Prosthetists.},

abstract = {Background: Astronaut spacewalk training can result in a variety of symptom complaints and possible injuries. This study quantified and characterized signs, symptoms, and injuries resulting from extravehicular activity spacesuit training at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX, immersion facility. Methods: We identified the frequency and incidence of symptoms by location, mechanisms of injury, and effective countermeasures. Recommendations were made to improve injury prevention, astronaut training, test preparation, and training hardware. At the end of each test, a questionnaire was completed documenting signs and symptoms, mechanisms of injury, and countermeasures. Results: Of the 770 tests, there were 190 in which; suit symptoms were reported (24.6{\%}). There were a total of 352 reported suit symptom comments. Of those symptoms, 166 were in the hands (47.16{\%}), 73 were in the shoulders (20.7{\%}), and 40 were in the feet (11.4{\%}). Others ranged from 6.0{\%} to 0.28{\%}, respectively, from the legs, arms, neck, trunk, groin, and head. Causal mechanisms for the hands included moisture and hard glove contacts resulting in fingernail injuries; in the shoulders, hard contact with suit components and strain mechanisms; and in the feet, hard boot contact. The severity of symptoms was highest in the shoulders, hands, and feet. Conclusions: Most signs and symptoms were mild, self-limited, of brief duration, and were well controlled by available countermeasures. Some represented the potential for significant injury with consequences affecting astronaut health and performance. Correction of extravehicular activity training-related injuries requires a multidisciplinary approach to improve prevention, medical intervention, astronaut training, test planning, and suit engineering.},

Fit has traditionally been hard to quantify, and space suits are an extreme example, where fit is difficult to measure but crucial for safety and operability. A proper space suit fit is particularly challenging because of NASA's desire to fit an incredibly diverse population (males and females from the 1st to 99th percentile) while developing a minimum number of space suit sizes. Because so few sizes are available, the available space suits must be optimized so that each fits a large segment of the population without compromising the fit of any one wearer. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {during extravehicular activity training and operations. These hand injuries have been known to cause fingernail delamination (onycholysis) that requires medical intervention. This study investigated correlations between the anthropometrics of the hand and susceptibility to injury. Methods: The analysis explored the hypothesis that crewmembers with a high finger-to-hand size ratio are more likely to experience injuries. A database of 232 crewmembers ' injury records and anthropometrics was sourced from NASA Johnson Space Center. Results: No significant effect of finger-to-hand size was found on the probability of injury, but circumference and width of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint were found to be significantly associated with injuries by the Kruskal-Wallis test. A multivariate logistic regression showed that hand circumference is the dominant effect on the likelihood of onycholysis. Discussion: Male crewmembers with a hand circumference ≤ 22.86 cm (9 ′ ) have a 19.6{\%} probability of finger injury, but those with hand circumferences {\textless} 22.86 cm (9 ′ ) only have a 5.6{\%} chance of injury. Findings were similar for female crewmembers. This increased probability may be due to constriction at large MCP joints by the current NASA Phase VI glove. Constriction may lead to occlusion of vascular flow to the fingers that may increase the chances of onycholysis. Injury rates are lower on gloves such as the superseded series 4000 and the Russian Orlan that provide more volume for the MCP joint. This suggests that we can reduce onycholysis by modifying the design of the current gloves at the MCP joint.

abstract = {Injuries to the hands are common among astronauts who train for extravehicular activity . When the gloves are pressurized, they restrict movement and create pressure points during tasks, sometimes resulting in pain, muscle fatigue, abrasions, and occasionally more severe injuries such as onycholysis. Glove injuries, both anecdotal and recorded, have been reported during EVA training and flight persistently through NASA's history regardless of mission or glove model. Theories as to causation such as glove-hand fit are common but often lacking in supporting evidence. Previous statistical analysis has evaluated onycholysis in the context of crew anthropometry only. The purpose of this study was to analyze all injuries and available risk factor variables with the goal to determine engineering and operational controls that may reduce hand injuries due to the EVA glove in the future. A literature review and data mining study were conducted between 2012 and 2014. This study included 179 US NASA crew who trained or completed an EVA between 1981 and 2010 and wore either the 4000 Series or Phase VI glove during Extravehicular Mobility Unit spacesuit EVA training and flight. All injuries recorded in medical records were analyzed in their association to candidate risk factor variables. Those risk factor variables included demographic characteristics, hand anthropometry, glove fit characteristics, and training/EVA characteristics. Utilizing literature, medical records and anecdotal causation comments recorded in crewmember injury data, investigators were able to identify several risk factors associated with increased risk of glove related injuries. Prime among them were smaller hand anthropometry, duration of individual suited exposures, and improper glove-hand fit as calculated by the difference in the anthropometry middle finger length compared to the baseline EVA glove middle finger length.},

@inproceedings{Menendez1993,
abstract = {The smallest manned spacecraft conceivable is the Extravehicular Activity Space Suit (EVA). It makes the astronaut autonomous on the space facilities, protecting him against the hostile environment and allowing the crew to provide sufficient performance and productivity. The specificity of the suit enclosure is related to the fact that it must ensure protection functions which are in conflict with the human performance function. For example, the enclosure is pressurized to protect the astronaut against the vacuum but such inner pressure rigidifies limbs and waist thus degrading mobility and working capability. The mobility is obtained through the combination of pressure tight bearings and one or two degrees of freedom (DOF) joints interfacing with a hard upper torso and hard bearings. In fact, the astronaut (motor) and the suit (passive) can be considered as two separate robots working in parallel, the performance depending on their compatibility and the level of the inner pressure. This paper is based on the European Space Suit soft joints development and gives a study about the soft joints performances and working behaviour, which is the most important parameter limiting the Suit Enclosure inner pressure and the Zero Prebreath Suits feasibility. It starts with the identification of design drivers, pointed out in accordance with the top level functional and performance requirements. Such drivers strongly influenced conceptual choices, which were reviewed by test campaigns, thus enabling parametric studies of the most important ones (e. g. torque versus range of motion). The second part of the paper analyses the torque performances of soft joints as a function of the inner pressure and mobility range for different types of joints, in order to give an assessment about the soft joints used for manufacturing a suit enclosure with an internal overpressure up to 600 hPa. The third part of the paper analyses the joint behaviour in function of the joint diameter, joint type, etc. and provides an assessment of the historical background, mass and level of available technology. In the end the paper makes reference to application (PACHA) of the technology developed for EVA Space Suits to the terrestrial human protection against a hostile environment. {\textcopyright} Copyright 1993 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.},

Beginning with the Gemini Program, enhanced mobility systems were developed to enable crewmembers to perform useful tasks outside the spacecraft.

abstract = {The Z-2 space suit is the product of the last fifty years of NASA's space suit research and testing experience. The suit was originally built as a prototype exploration space suit to evaluate advances in suit design and technology for use on a planetary surface. After the delivery of Z-2, however, NASA shifted focus and sought to evaluate the feasibility of using design features of the Z-2 suit to inform the design of the xEMU Demo space suit, which will be demonstrated on the International Space Station (ISS). Aside from being developed primarily to evaluate the overall architecture of the xEMU space suit, the xEMU Demo may also supplement or replace the existing Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). To evaluate the microgravity performance of the Z-2 architecture for compatibility on the ISS, the suit was tested in NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL), which is the primary microgravity testing environment for space suits. The Z-2 NBL test series began in the fall of 2016 and concluded in the fall of 2017. Five astronauts performed various tasks that are representative of the tasks performed on the ISS. Test subjects performed tasks in the Z-2 suit and the EMU so that relative comparisons could be drawn between the two suits. Two configurations of the Z-2 space suit were evaluated during this test series: the ELTA configuration and the ZLTA configuration. The ELTA configuration, which was the primary test configuration, is comprised of the Z-2 upper torso and the EMU lower torso. The ZLTA configuration is comprised of the Z-2 upper torso with the Z-2 lower torso, which contains additional mobility elements. This paper discusses the test results from the Z-2 NBL test series.

Although reports by astronauts of the Apollo missions indicate alternative gait strategies might be favored on the Moon, computational simulations and experimental investigations have been almost exclusively limited to the study of either walking or running, the locomotion modes preferred under Earth's gravity. In order to investigate the gait strategies likely to be favored at low gravity a series of predictive, computational simulations of gait are performed using a physiological model of the musculoskeletal system, without assuming any particular type of gait. A computationally efficient optimization strategy is utilized allowing for multiple simulations. The results reveal skipping as more efficient and less fatiguing than walking or running and suggest the existence of a walk-skip rather than a walk-run transition at low gravity. The results are expected to serve as a background to the design of experimental investigations of gait under simulated low gravity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The work done at each step during level walking and running to lift the centre of mass of the body, Wv, and to increase its forward speed, Wf, and the total mechanical energy involved (potential + kinetic) Wext, have been measured at various 'constant' speeds (2‐32 km/hr) with the technique described by Cavagna (1975). 2. At intermediate speeds of walking (about 4 km/hr) Wv = Wf and Wext/km is at a minimum, as is the energy cost. At lower speeds Wv greater than Wf whereas at higher speeds Wf greather than Wv: in both cases Wext/km increases. 3. The recovery of mechanical energy, through the pendular motion characteristic of walking, was measured as (/Wv/ + /Wf/ ‐ Wext)/(/Wv/ + /Wf/): it attains a maximum (about 65{\%}) at intermediate speeds. 4. A simple model, assuming that in walking the body rotates as an inverted pendulum over the foot in contact with the ground, fits the experimental data better at intermediate speeds but is no longer tenable above 7 km/hr. 5. In running the recovery defined above is minimal (0‐4{\%} independent of speed), i.e. Wext congruent to /Wv/ + /Wf/: potential and kinetic energy of the body do not interchange but are simultaneously taken up and released by the muscles with a rate increasing markedly with the speed (from about 1 to 4 h.p.). 6. Wext increases linearly with the running speed Vf from a positive y intercept owing to the fact that Wv is practically constant independent of Vf. On the contrary, Wf = aVf2/(1 + bVf), where b is the ratio between the time spent in the air and the forward distance covered while on the ground during each step. {\textcopyright} 1976 The Physiological Society},

Walking, in all animals (as in man), involves an alternate transfer between gravitational-potential energy and kinetic energy within each stride (as takes place in a pendulum). This transfer is greatest at intermediate walking speeds and can account for up to 70{\%} of the total energy changes taking place within a stride, leaving only 30{\%} to be supplied by muscles. No kinetic-gravitational energy transfer takes place during running, hopping, and trotting, but energy is conserved by another mechanism: an elastic 'bounce' of the body. Galloping animals utilize a combination of these two energy-conserving mechanisms. During running, trotting, hopping, and galloping, 1) the power per unit weight required to maintain the forward speed of the center of mass is almost the same in all the species studied; 2) the power per unit weight required to lift the center of mass is almost independent of speed; and 3) the sum of these two powers is almost a linear function of speed.},

abstract = {We studied the changes of vertical contact forces, lower limb kinematics, and electromyographic activity (EMG) at different speeds and gravitational loads. To this end healthy subjects were asked to walk on a motorized treadmill while the percentage of body weight unloaded (body weight support, BWS) was modified in steps by means of a well-characterized unloading system. BWS was set at 0, 35, 50, 75, 95, or 100{\%} of body weight. Walking speed was 0.7, 1.1, 2, 3, or 5 km/h. We found that changing BWS between 0 and 95{\%} resulted in drastic changes of kinetic parameters but in limited changes of the kinematic coordination. In particular, the peak vertical contact forces decreased proportionally to BWS; at 95{\%}-BWS they were 20-fold smaller than at 0{\%} and were applied at the forefoot only. Also, there were considerable changes of the amplitude of EMG activity of all tested lower limb muscles and a complex re-organization of the pattern of activity of thigh muscles. By contrast, the corresponding variation of the parameters that describe shape and variability of the foot path was very limited, always {\textless}30{\%} of the corresponding values at 0 BWS. Moreover, the planar covariation of the elevation angles was obeyed at all speed and BWS values. Minimum variance of limb trajectory occurred at 3 km/h. At 100{\%} BWS, subjects stepped in the air, their feet oscillating back and forth just above but never contacting the treadmill. In this case, step-to-step variability of foot path was much greater than at all other BWS levels but was restored to lower values when minimal surrogate contact forces were provided during the "stance" phase. The results did not depend on the specific instruction given to the subject. Therefore we conclude that minimal contact forces are sufficient for accurate foot trajectory control.},

We simulated reduced gravity using an apparatus that applied a nearly constant upward force at the center of mass, and the subjects walked and ran on a motorized treadmill. In the inverted pendulum model for walking, gravity provides the centripetal force needed to keep the pendulum in contact with the ground. The ratio of the centripetal and gravitational forces (mv2/L)/(mg) reduces to the dimensionless Froude number (v2/gL). Applying this model to a walking human, m is body mass, v is forward velocity, L is leg length and g is gravity. In normal gravity, humans and other bipeds with different leg lengths all choose to switch from a walk to a run at different absolute speeds but at approximately the same Froude number (0.5). We found that, at lower levels of gravity, the walk-run transition occurred at progressively slower absolute speeds but at approximately the same Froude number. This supports the hypothesis that the walk-run transition is triggered by the dynamics of an inverted-pendulum system.},

abstract = {The Froude number (a ratio of inertial to gravitational forces) predicts the occurrence of dynamic similarity in legged animals over a wide range of sizes and velocities for both walking and running gaits at Earth gravity. This is puzzling because the Froude number ignores elastic forces that are crucial for understanding running gaits. We used simulated reduced gravity as a tool for exploring dynamic similarity in human running. We simulated reduced gravity by applying a nearly constant upward force to the torsos of our subjects while they ran on a treadmill. We found that at equal Froude numbers, achieved through different combinations of velocity and levels of gravity, our subjects did not run in a dynamically similar manner. Thus, the inertial and gravitational forces that comprise the Froude number were not sufficient to characterize running in reduced gravity. Further, two dimensionless numbers that incorporate elastic forces, the Groucho number and the vertical Strouhal number, also failed to predict dynamic similarity in reduced-gravity running. To better understand the separate effects of velocity and gravity, we also studied running mechanics at fixed absolute velocities under different levels of gravity. The effects of velocity and gravity on the requirements of dynamic similarity differed in both magnitude and direction, indicating that there are no two velocity and gravity combinations at which humans will prefer to run in a dynamically similar manner. A comparison of walking and running results demonstrated that reduced gravity had different effects on the mechanics of each gait. This suggests that a single unifying hypothesis for the effects of size, velocity and gravity on both walking and running gaits will not be successful.},

abstract = {Human locomotion in simulated lunar and Martian environments is investigated. A unique human-rated underwater treadmill and an adjustable ballasting harness simulate partial gravity in order to better understand how gravity determines the biomechanics and energetics of human locomotion. This study has two research aspects, biomechanics and energetics. The fundamental biomechanics measurements are continuously recorded vertical forces as exerted by subjects of the treadmill which is instrumented with a force platform. Experimental results indicate that peak vertical force and stride frequency decrease as the gravity level is reduced. Foot contact time is independent of gravity level. Oxygen uptake measurements, VO2, constitute the energetics, or workload, data for this study. As theory predicts, locomotion energy requirements for lunar ( 1 6-g) and Martian ( 3 8-g) gravity levels are significantly less than at 1-g. The observed variation in workload with gravity level is nonmonotonic, however, in over half the subject population. The hypothesis is offered that energy expenditure increases for lunar, as compared with Martian, locomotion due to the subject "wasting energy" for stability and posture control in simulated lunar gravity. Biomechanics data could influence advanced spacesuit design and planetary habitat design, while workload data will help define oxygen requirements for planetary life support systems. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

@article{Carr2009,
abstract = {Background: How space suits affect the preferred walk-run transition is an open question with relevance to human biomechanics and planetary extravehicular activity. Walking and running energetics differ; in reduced gravity ({\textless}0.5 g), running, unlike on Earth, uses less energy per distance than walking. Methodology/Principal Findings: The walk-run transition (denoted *) correlates with the Froude Number (Fr=v2/gL, velocity v, gravitational acceleration g, leg length L). Human unsuited Fr* is relatively constant (∼0.5) with gravity but increases substantially with decreasing gravity below ∼0.4 g, rising to 0.9 in 1/6 g; space suits appear to lower Fr*. Because of pressure forces, space suits partially (1 g) or completely (lunar-g) support their own weight. We define the Apollo Number (Ap=Fr/M) as an expected invariant of locomotion under manipulations of M, the ratio of human-supported to total transported mass. We hypothesize that for lunar suited conditions Ap* but not Fr* will be near 0.9, because the Apollo Number captures the effect of space suit self-support. We used the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal and other sources to identify 38 gait events during lunar exploration for which we could determine gait type (walk/lope/run) and calculate Ap. We estimated the binary transition between walk/lope (0) and run (1), yielding Fr* (0.36±0.11, mean±95{\%} CI) and Ap* 0.68±0.20). Conclusions/Significance: The Apollo Number explains 60{\%} of the difference between suited and unsuited Fr*, appears to capture in large part the effects of space suits on the walk-run transition, and provides several testable predictions for space suit locomotion and, of increasing relevance here on Earth, exoskeleton locomotion. The knowledge of how space suits affect gait transitions can be used to optimize space suits for use on the Moon and Mars. {\textcopyright} 2009 Carr, McGee.},

abstract = {The metabolic cost of walking is determined by many mechanical tasks, but the individual contribution of each task remains unclear. We hypothesized that the force generated to support body weight and the work performed to redirect and accelerate body mass each individually incur a significant metabolic cost during normal walking. To test our hypothesis, we measured changes in metabolic rate in response to combinations of simulated reduced gravity and added loading. We found that reducing body weight by simulating reduced gravity modestly decreased net metabolic rate. By calculating the metabolic cost per Newton of reduced body weight, we deduced that generating force to support body weight comprises ∼28{\%} of the metabolic cost of normal walking. Similar to previous loading studies, we found that adding both weight and mass increased net metabolic rate in more than direct proportion to load. However, when we added mass alone by using a combination of simulated reduced gravity and added load, net metabolic rate increased about one-half as much as when we added both weight and mass. By calculating the cost per kilogram of added mass, we deduced that the work performed on the center of mass comprises ∼45{\%} of the metabolic cost of normal walking. Our findings support the hypothesis that force and work each incur a significant metabolic cost. Specifically, the cost of performing work to redirect and accelerate the center of mass is almost twice as great as the cost of generating force to support body weight.},

@article{Cullinane2017a,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The Mark III (MIII) space suit assembly (SSAs) implements a multibearing, hard-material hip brief assembly (HBA). We hypothesize that: 1) the MIII HBA restricts operator mobility and agility which manifests in effects to gait parameters; 2) the waist bearing provides rotational motion, partially alleviating the restrictions; and 3) there are resistive, speeddependent torques associated with the spinning bearings which further diminish mobility and agility. METHODS: A subject (Suited and Unsuited) performed two planetary tasks-walking forward (WF) and backward (WB). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc comparisons were performed to determine interaction effects. Motion capture data was processed to obtain gait parameters: static base (m), dynamic base (m), step length (m), stride length (m), cadence (steps/min), center of mass speed (m {\textperiodcentered} s-1), foot clearance (toe and heel) (m), and bearing angular velocities (° {\textperiodcentered} s-1). RESULTS: The static base when Suited (0.355 m) was larger than Unsuited (0.263 m). The Suited dynamic base (pooled, 0.200 m) was larger than both Unsuited WF (0.081 m) and WB (0.107 m). When Suited, the operator had lower clearance heights. The waist bearings provided about 7.2° of rotation when WB and WF. The maximum torque, while WF, in the right upper and mid bearings was 15.6 ± 1.35 Nm and 16.3 ± 1.28 Nm. DISCUSSION: This study integrated suit component properties and the emergent biomechanics of the operator to investigate how biomechanics are affected. The human hip has three collocated degrees of freedom (DOFs), whereas the HBA has a single DOF per bearing. The results can inform requirements for future SSA and other wearable system designs and evaluations.},

@article{Stirling2020,
abstract = {Objective: To define static, dynamic, and cognitive fit and their interactions as they pertain to exosystems and to document open research needs in using these fit characteristics to inform exosystem design. Background: Initial exosystem sizing and fit evaluations are currently based on scalar anthropometric dimensions and subjective assessments. As fit depends on ongoing interactions related to task setting and user, attempts to tailor equipment have limitations when optimizing for this limited fit definition. Method: A targeted literature review was conducted to inform a conceptual framework defining three characteristics of exosystem fit: static, dynamic, and cognitive. Details are provided on the importance of differentiating fit characteristics for developing exosystems. Results: Static fit considers alignment between human and equipment and requires understanding anthropometric characteristics of target users and geometric equipment features. Dynamic fit assesses how the human and equipment move and interact with each other, with a focus on the relative alignment between the two systems. Cognitive fit considers the stages of human-information processing, including somatosensation, executive function, and motor selection. Human cognitive capabilities should remain available to process task- and stimulus-related information in the presence of an exosystem. Dynamic and cognitive fit are operationalized in a task-specific manner, while static fit can be considered for predefined postures. Conclusion: A deeper understanding of how an exosystem fits an individual is needed to ensure good human–system performance. Development of methods for evaluating different fit characteristics is necessary. Application: Methods are presented to inform exosystem evaluation across physical and cognitive characteristics.},

NASA requires all hardware, including spacesuits, vehicles, and control interfaces, to accommodate the maximum proportion of the population on critical dimensions. In addition, the designs must allow for completing mission tasks safely at optimal performance. However, given the complexity of hardware and the microgravity or partial gravity environments in which it is used, physical prototype testing with human subjects can be extremely costly and difficult to accurately simulate on the ground. Human modeling tools have been developed at NASA to visualize and predict potential issues in hardware design. The developed models have been used for critical areas including virtual suit fit assessments, in-flight body shape changes, and the measurements of suited mobility. Overall, human modeling tools have enabled the assessment of human-in-the-loop designs that would have been otherwise impossible. Future development efforts are directed toward the modeling of dynamic motions of suited crewmembers and integration with functional metrics such as strength, performance, and minimal risk of injury.},

abstract = {Shoulder injury is one of the most severe risks that have the potential to impair crewmembers' performance and health in long duration space flight. Overall, 64{\%} of crewmembers experience shoulder pain after extra-vehicular training in a space suit, and 14{\%} of symptomatic crewmembers require surgical repair (Williams {\&} Johnson, 2003). Suboptimal suit fit, in particular at the shoulder region, has been identified as one of the predominant risk factors. However, traditional suit fit assessments and laser scans represent only a single person's data, and thus may not be generalized across wide variations of body shapes and poses. The aim of this work is to develop a software tool based on a statistical analysis of a large dataset of crewmember body shapes. This tool can accurately predict the skin deformation and shape variations for any body size and shoulder pose for a target population, from which the geometry can be exported and evaluated against suit models in commercial CAD software. A preliminary software tool was developed by statistically analyzing 150 body shapes matched with body dimension ranges specified in the Human-Systems Integration Requirements of NASA ("baseline model"). Further, the baseline model was incorporated with shoulder joint articulation ("articulation model"), using additional subjects scanned in a variety of shoulder poses across a pre-specified range of motion. Scan data was cleaned and aligned using body landmarks. The skin deformation patterns were dimensionally reduced and the co-variation with shoulder angles was analyzed. A software tool is currently in development and will be presented in the final proceeding. This tool would allow suit engineers to parametrically generate body shapes in strategically targeted anthropometry dimensions and shoulder poses. This would also enable virtual fit assessments, with which the contact volume and clearance between the suit and body surface can be predictively quantified at reduced time and cost.},

abstract = {There are multiple challenges associated with extravehicular activity (EVA). The design of a spacesuit requires specific attention to the mobility of astronauts. All of the currently flown spacesuits are gas-pressurized and can perform a wide range of functions. However, the pressurization causes an inherent stiffness, leading to astronaut's fatigue, unnecessary energy expenditure and impeded mobility. The first goal of this study was to characterize the kinematics of the person inside the suit and to compare it to the kinematics of the suit as a result of the person's motion inside. The second goal of the study was to demonstrate that wearable technologies such as kinematics sensors could be implemented safely and efficiently in the space suit environment to better assess the interactions between the human and the spacesuit and to better monitor the performance of EVA. The study was performed in two different suits: the David Clark Mobility Mockup and the NASA Mark III. The current industry standard to measure spacesuit kinematics is motion capture video. Although this technology allows external motion of the suit to be reliably measured, it does not measure the person's motions inside the suit. This technology is also restricted to laboratory settings due to equipment constraints. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) use accelerometers and gyroscopes to estimate relative rotation. IMU systems are mobile and low-power, offering an economical and efficient kinematic tracking capability. In this study, we applied IMU sensors to study space-suited motions. We placed IMUs on the lower arm, upper arm and torso, both inside, on the person's body and outside, on the space suit. This configuration permits evaluation of the elbow and the shoulder joint angles, both internal and external to the suit. Subjects performed three types of isolated motions: elbow flexion/extension, shoulder flexion/extension and shoulder abduction/adduction. For each task, a comparison of joint angles between the human arm and the suit arm has been realized. A comparison of the angle's amplitude between the suited pressurized condition and either the suited unpressurized or unsuited condition was performed. The results show the different kinematics between the human inside the suit and the suit. A statistically significant impairment of mobility between baseline and pressurized conditions has also been demonstrated.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Human-spacesuit fit is not well understood, especially in relation to operational performance and injury risk. Current fit decisions use subjective feedback. This work developed and evaluated new metrics for quantifying fit and assessed metric sensitivity to changes in padding between the human and hip brief assembly (HBA). METHODS: Three subjects donned the Mark III (MKIII) spacesuit with three padding thicknesses between the lower body and HBA. Subjects performed a walking task with inertial measurement units on the thigh and shin of both the human and suit. For each step, cadence, human knee task range of motion (tRoM), difference in human and suit tROM ($\Delta$tRoM), and the relative coordination metric ($\rho$) between the human-suit femur and tibia were computed. RESULTS: The MKIII significantly reduced user cadence by 20.4{\%} and reduced tRoM by 16.5{\%} during walking with subjectdependent changes due to added padding. In general, the addition of padding significantly altered $\Delta$tRoM; however, variability did exist between subjects. Mixed-effect regressions of dynamic fit ($\rho$) reflect distinct positive spikes in r around heel strike (human-dominated motion) and negative dips following toe off (suit-dominated motion). DISCUSSION: There were mixed effects of padding on gait performance and dynamic fit measures. Differences in dynamic fit between subjects may be more reliant on alternate aspects of fit, such as suit component sizes and designs, than padding level. Subjective feedback supported quantitative observations, highlighting metric utility. Future work will explore the effects of suit sizing components on measures of fit and performance.},

abstract = {There are many design challenges in creating at-home tele-monitoring systems that enable quantification and visualization of complex biomechanical behavior. One such challenge is robustly quantifying joint coordination in a way that is intuitive and supports clinical decision-making. This work defines a new measure of coordination called the relative coordination metric (RCM) and its accompanying normalization schemes. RCM enables quantification of coordination during non-constrained discrete motions. Here RCM is applied to a grasping task. Fifteen healthy participants performed a reach, grasp, transport, and release task with a cup and a pen. The measured joint angles were then time-normalized and the RCM time-series were calculated between the shoulder-elbow, shoulder-wrist, and elbow-wrist. RCM was normalized using four differing criteria: the selected joint degree of freedom, angular velocity, angular magnitude, and range of motion. Percent time spent in specified RCM ranges was used as a composite metric and was evaluated for each trial. RCM was found to vary based on: (1) chosen normalization scheme, (2) the stage within the task, (3) the object grasped, and (4) the trajectory of the motion. The RCM addresses some of the limitations of current measures of coordination because it is applicable to discrete motions, does not rely on cyclic repetition, and uses velocity-based measures. Future work will explore clinically relevant differences in the RCM as it is expanded to evaluate different tasks and patient populations.},

@article{Rebula2013,
abstract = {Gait parameters such as stride length, width, and period, as well as their respective variabilities, are widely used as indicators of mobility and walking function. Foot placement and its variability have thus been applied in areas such as aging, fall risk, spinal cord injury, diabetic neuropathy, and neurological conditions. But a drawback is that these measures are presently best obtained with specialized laboratory equipment such as motion capture systems and instrumented walkways, which may not be available in many clinics and certainly not during daily activities. One alternative is to fix inertial measurement units (IMUs) to the feet or body to gather motion data. However, few existing methods measure foot placement directly, due to drift associated with inertial data. We developed a method to measure stride-to-stride foot placement in unconstrained environments, and tested whether it can accurately quantify gait parameters over long walking distances. The method uses ground contact conditions to correct for drift, and state estimation algorithms to improve estimation of angular orientation. We tested the method with healthy adults walking over-ground, averaging 93 steps per trial, using a mobile motion capture system to provide reference data. We found IMU estimates of mean stride length and duration within 1{\%} of motion capture, and standard deviations of length and width within 4{\%} of motion capture. Step width cannot be directly estimated by IMUs, although lateral stride variability can. Inertial sensors measure walks over arbitrary distances, yielding estimates with good statistical confidence. Gait can thus be measured in a variety of environments, and even applied to long-term monitoring of everyday walking. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

The proposed method is compared with an existing method that uses force sensitive resistors placed under the foot.

abstract = {Background Although walking speed is associated with important clinical outcomes and designated as the sixth vital sign of the elderly, few walking-speed estimation algorithms using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) have been derived and tested in the older adults, especially in the elderly with slow speed. We aimed to develop a walking-speed estimation algorithm for older adults based on an IMU. Methods We used data from 659 of 785 elderly enrolled from the cohort study. We measured gait using an IMU attached on the lower back while participants walked around a 28 m long round walkway thrice at comfortable paces. Best-fit linear regression models were developed using selected demographic, anthropometric, and IMU features to estimate the walking speed. The accuracy of the algorithm was verified using mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) in an independent validation set. Additionally, we verified concurrent validity with GAITRite using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results The proposed algorithm incorporates the age, sex, foot length, vertical displacement, cadence, and step-time variability obtained from an IMU sensor. It exhibited high estimation accuracy for the walking speed of the elderly and remarkable concurrent validity compared to the GAITRite (MAE = 4.70{\%}, RMSE = 6.81 cm/s, concurrent validity (ICC (3,1)) = 0.937). Moreover, it achieved high estimation accuracy even for slow walking by applying a slowspeed-specific regression model sequentially after estimation by a general regression model. The accuracy was higher than those obtained with models based on the human gait model with or without calibration to fit the population. Conclusions The developed inertial-sensor-based walking-speed estimation algorithm can accurately estimate the walking speed of older adults.},

abstract = {Gait event detection is a crucial step towards the effective assessment and rehabilitation of motor dysfunctions. Recently, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) based methods have been increasingly proposed for gait event detection due to their robustness. However, few investigations on determining the appropriate mother wavelet with proper selection criteria have been performed, especially for hemiplegic patients. In this study, the performances of commonly used mother wavelets in detecting gait events were systematically investigated. The acceleration signals from the tibialis anterior muscle of both healthy and hemiplegic subjects were recorded during ground walking and the two core gait events of heel strike (HS) and toe off (TO) were detected from the signal recordings by a CWT algorithm with different mother wavelets. Our results showed that the overall performance of the CWT algorithm in detecting the two gait events was significantly different when using various mother wavelets. By using different wavelet selection criteria, we also found that the accuracy criteria based on time-error minimization and F1-score maximization could provide the appropriate mother wavelet for gait event detection. The findings from this study will provide an insight on the selection of an appropriate mother wavelet for gait event detection and facilitate the development of adequate rehabilitation aids.},

This study aimed, first, to describe a novel method for detecting stance and inner-stance temporal events based on foot-worn inertial sensors; second, to extract and validate relevant metrics from those events; and third, to investigate their suitability as clinical outcome for gait evaluations. 42 subjects including healthy subjects and patients before and after surgical treatments for ankle osteoarthritis performed 50-m walking trials while wearing foot-worn inertial sensors and pressure insoles as a reference system. Several hypotheses were evaluated to detect heel-strike, toe-strike, heel-off, and toe-off based on kinematic features. Detected events were compared with the reference system on 3193 gait cycles and showed good accuracy and precision. Absolute and relative stance periods, namely loading response, foot-flat, and push-off were then estimated, validated, and compared statistically between populations. Besides significant differences observed in stance duration, the analysis revealed differing tendencies with notably a shorter foot-flat in healthy subjects. The result indicated which features in inertial sensors' signals should be preferred for detecting precisely and accurately temporal events against a reference standard. The system is suitable for clinical evaluations and provides temporal analysis of gait beyond the common swing/stance decomposition, through a quantitative estimation of inner-stance phases such as foot-flat. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The metabolic energy cost of walking is determined, to a large degree, by body mass, but it is not clear how body composition and mass distribution influence this cost. We tested the hypothesis that walking would be most expensive for obese women compared with obese men and normal-weight women and men. Furthermore, we hypothesized that for all groups, preferred walking speed would correspond to the speed that minimized the gross energy cost per distance. We measured body composition, maximal oxygen consumption, and preferred walking speed of 39 (19 class II obese, 20 normal weight) women and men. We also measured oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production while the subjects walked on a level treadmill at six speeds (0.50-1.75 m/s). Both obesity and sex affected the net metabolic rate (W/kg) of walking. Net metabolic rates of obese subjects were only ∼10{\%} greater (per kg) than for normal-weight subjects, and net metabolic rates for women were ∼10{\%} greater than for men. The increase in net metabolic rate at faster walking speeds was greatest in obese women compared with the other groups. Preferred walking speed was not different across groups (1.42 m/s) and was near the speed that minimized gross energy cost per distance. Surprisingly, mass distribution (thigh mass/body mass) was not related to net metabolic rate, but body composition ({\%} fat) was (r2 = 0.43). Detailed biomechanical studies of walking are needed to investigate whether obese individuals adopt novel energy saving mechanisms during walking.

In this paper we present one of our most recent initiatives in the areas of point cloud perception: PCL (Point Cloud Library - http://pointclouds.org). PCL presents an advanced and extensive approach to the subject of 3D perception, and it's meant to provide support for all the common 3D building blocks that applications need. The library contains state-of-the art algorithms for: filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and segmentation. PCL is supported by an international community of robotics and perception researchers. We provide a brief walkthrough of PCL including its algorithmic capabilities and implementation strategies. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Algebraic Point Set Surfaces (APSS) define a smooth surface from a set of points using local moving least-squares (MLS) fitting of algebraic spheres. In this paper we first revisit the spherical fitting problem and provide a new, more generic solution that includes intuitive parameters for curvature control of the fitted spheres. As a second contribution we present a novel real-time rendering system of such surfaces using a dynamic up-sampling strategy combined with a conventional splatting algorithm for high quality rendering. Our approach also includes a new view dependent geometric error tailored to efficient and adaptive up-sampling of the surface. One of the key features of our system is its high degree of flexibility that enables us to achieve high performance even for highly dynamic data or complex models by exploiting temporal coherence at the primitive level. We also address the issue of efficient spatial search data structures with respect to construction, access and GPU friendliness. Finally, we present an efficient parallel GPU implementation of the algorithms and search structures. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Author(s).},

abstract = {In this paper we present a new Point Set Surface (PSS) definition based on moving least squares (MLS) fitting of algebraic spheres. Our surface representation can be expressed by either a projection procedure or in implicit form. The central advantages of our approach compared to existing planar MLS include significantly improved stability of the projection under low sampling rates and in the presence of high curvature. The method can approximate or interpolate the input point set and naturally handles planar point clouds. In addition, our approach provides a reliable estimate of the mean curvature of the surface at no additional cost and allows for the robust handling of sharp features and boundaries. It processes a simple point set as input, but can also take significant advantage of surface normals to improve robustness, quality and performance. We also present an novel normal estimation procedure which exploits the properties of the spherical fit for both direction estimation and orientation propagation. Very efficient computational procedures enable us to compute the algebraic sphere fitting with up to 40 million points per second on latest generation GPUs. {\textcopyright} 2007 ACM.},

abstract = {Quantifying human femoral cortex morphology is important for forensic science, surgical planning, prosthesis design and musculoskeletal modeling. Previous studies have been restricted by traditional zero or one dimensional morphometric measurements at discrete locations. We have used automatic image segmentation and statistical shape modeling methods to create predictive models of baseline 3-D femoral cortex morphology on a statistically significant population. A total of 204 femurs were automatically segmented and measured to obtain 3-D shape, whole-surface cortical thickness, and morphometric measurements. Principal components of shape and cortical thickness were correlated to anthropological data (age, sex, height and body mass) to produce predictive statistical models. We show that predictions of an individual's age, height, and sex can be improved by using 3-D shape and cortical thickness when compared with traditional morphometric measurements. We also show that femoral cortex geometry can be predicted from anthropological data combined with femoral measurements with less than 2.3. mm root mean square error, and cortical thickness with less than 0.5. mm root mean square error. The predictive models presented offer new ways to infer subject-specific 3-D femur morphology from sparse subject data for biomechanical simulations, and inversely infer subject data from femur morphology for anthropological and forensic studies.},

abstract = {A statistical body shape model (SBSM) for children was developed for generating a child body shape with desired anthropometric parameters. A standardised template mesh was fit to whole-body laser scan data from 137 children aged 3–11 years. The mesh coordinates along with a set of surface landmarks and 27 manually measured anthropometric variables were analysed using principal component (PC) analysis. PC scores were associated with anthropometric predictors such as stature, body mass index (BMI) and ratio of erect sitting height to stature (SHS) using a regression model. When the original scan data were compared with the predictions of the SBSM using each subject's stature, BMI and SHS, the mean absolute error was 10.4 ± 5.8 mm, and 95th percentile error was 24.0 ± 18.5 mm. The model, publicly available online, will have utility for a wide range of applications. Practitioner Summary: A statistical body shape model for children helps to account for inter-individual variability in body shapes as well as anthropometric dimensions. This parametric modelling approach is useful for reliable prediction of the body shape of a specific child with a few given predictors such as stature, body mass index and age.},

abstract = {Anthropometric data are widely used in the design of chairs, seats, and other furniture intended for seated use. These data are valuable for determining the overall height, width, and depth of a chair, but contain little information about body shape that can be used to choose appropriate contours for backrests. A new method is presented for statistical modeling of three-dimensional torso shape for use in designing chairs and seats. Laser-scan data from a large-scale civilian anthropometric survey were extracted and analyzed using principal component analysis. Multivariate regression was applied to predict the average body shape as a function of overall anthropometric variables. For optimization applications, the statistical model can be exercised to randomly sample the space of torso shapes for automated virtual fitting trials. This approach also facilitates trade-off analyses and other the application of other design decision-making methods. Although seating is the specific example here, the method is generally applicable to other designing for human variability situations in which applicable body contour data are available.

@article{Stankovic2020,
abstract = {The high prevalence of foot pain, and its relation to foot shape, indicates the need for an expert system to identify foot shape abnormalities. Yet, to date, no such expert system exists that examines the full 3D foot shape and produces an intuitive explanation of why a foot is abnormal. In this work, we present the first such expert system that satisfies those goals. The system is based on the concept of model-based outlier detection: a statistical shape model (SSM) is generated from 186 3D optical foot scans of healthy feet. This model acts as a knowledge base which is then parameterized by one's demographic characteristics (e.g., age, weight, height, shoe size) through a multivariate regression. This regression introduces model flexibility as it allows the model to be fine tuned to a specific individual. This fine tuned model is then used as a baseline to which the individual's 3D foot scan can be compared using standard statistical tests (e.g. t-tests). These statistical tests are performed at each vertex along the foot surface to identify the degree and location of shape outliers. Our expert system was validated on foot scans from patients with hallux valgus and abnormal foot arches. As expected, our results varied per patient, confirming that feet with the same clinical classification still show high shape variability. Additionally, the foot shape abnormalities identified by our system not only agreed with the expected location and severity of the tested foot deformities, but our analysis of the full 3D foot shape was able to completely characterize the extent of those abnormalities for the first time. These results show that the combination of statistical shape modelling, multivariate regression, and statistical testing is powerful enough to perform outlier detection for 3D foot shapes. The resulting insights provided by this system could prove useful in both shoe design and clinical diagnosis.},

Images of the sole were measured using a high-speed video camera (120 Hz). Cross-section shapes and derived dimensions were compared between the standing condition, first peak (P1), and midstance valley of two peaks (MSV) of vGRF during walking. Heel and Navicular cross-sections were more laterally inclined during walking than during standing by 6° on average. Compared to at standing, breadth of the cross-section in contact with the ground was wider at the heel and instep at timing P1, and was wider at the forefoot and narrower at heel at timing MSV. Medial length was longer and dorsal arch was higher during walking than during standing. Plantar arch height did not differ between the three conditions. The maximum difference in plantar arch height between standing and P1 was 1.3 mm, much smaller than the inter-individual variation of 7 mm. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Context: Footwear performance and injury mitigation may be compromised if the footwear is not properly sized for an athlete. Additionally, poor fit may result in discomfort and foot injury such as fifth metatarsal stress fracture, foot deformities, turf toe, and blisters. Current footwear fitting methods consist of foot length and width measurements, which may not properly describe the shape of the individual foot, correlated with shoe size descriptors that are not standardized. Footwear manufacturers employ a range of sizing rubrics, which introduces shoe size and shape variability between and even within footwear companies. This article describes the synthesis of literature to inform the development and deployment of an objective footwear fitting system in the National Football League (NFL). The process may inform athletic footwear fitting at other levels of play and in other sports. Evidence Acquisition: Literature related to footwear fitting, sizing, and foot scanning from 1980 through 2017 was compiled using electronic databases. Reference lists of articles were examined for additional relevant studies. Sixty-five sources are included in this descriptive review. Study Type: Descriptive review. Level of Evidence: Level 5. Results: Current methods of footwear fitting and variability in the size and shape of athletic footwear complicate proper fitting of footwear to athletes. An objective measurement and recommendation system that can match the 3-dimensional shape of an athlete's foot to the internal shape of available shoe models can provide important guidance for footwear selection. One such system has been deployed in the NFL. Conclusion: An objective footwear fitting system based on 3-dimensional shape matching of feet and shoes can facilitate the selection of footwear that properly fits an athlete's foot.},

abstract = {In human gait analysis studies, the entire foot is typically modeled as a single rigid-body segment; however, this neglects power generated/absorbed within the foot. Here we show how treating the entire foot as a rigid body can lead to misunderstandings related to (biological and prosthetic) foot function, and distort our understanding of ankle and muscle-tendon dynamics. We overview various (unconventional) inverse dynamics methods for estimating foot power, partitioning ankle vs. foot contributions, and computing combined anklefoot power. We present two case study examples. The first exemplifies how modeling the foot as a single rigid-body segment causes us to overestimate (and overvalue) muscle-tendon power generated about the biological ankle (in this study by up to 77{\%}), and to misestimate (and misinform on) foot contributions; corroborating findings from previous multi-segment foot modeling studies. The second case study involved an individual with transtibial amputation walking on 8 different prosthetic feet. The results exemplify how assuming a rigid foot can skew comparisons between biological and prosthetic limbs, and lead to incorrect conclusions when comparing different prostheses/interventions. Based on analytical derivations, empirical findings and prior literature we recommend against computing conventional ankle power (between shank-foot). Instead, we recommend using an alternative estimate of power generated about the ankle joint complex (between shank-calcaneus) in conjunction with an estimate of foot power (between calcaneus-ground); or using a combined anklefoot power calculation. We conclude that treating the entire foot as a rigid-body segment is often inappropriate and ill-advised. Including foot power in biomechanical gait analysis is necessary to enhance scientific conclusions, clinical evaluations and technology development.},

abstract = {Safety shoe development is based on static foot measures, which are transferred to last design. However, workplaces are not just static (‘standing workplaces only'). The aim of the present study is to examine static and dynamic foot loading of workers to determine whether foot morphology changes between different loading situations. The results could be used to improve last and shoe design to improve the fit of safety shoes. 1024 workers at different industrial locations in Germany took part in the study. The DynaScan4D dynamic scanner system was used to measure static and dynamic foot morphology during different phases of ground contact. All scan variables were selected based on measures required in the last development process. Cohen's d (effect size) was calculated to identify individual differences between maximum values during the stance phase of walking and static values in standing. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify possible influencing variables with regard to differences between static and dynamic values. Several foot measures showed relevant differences between dynamic and static loading. Interestingly, most length, width, height, and angular measures increased during dynamic loading (compared to static loading), whereas all circumference measures decreased. None of the tested variables (age, BMI, gender) predicted the differences between the two loading situations. Most dynamic changes are practical relevant changes between static and dynamic loading. Regarding the fit of safety shoes, it seems appropriate to adapt these changes to the last or shoe design.},

abstract = {Footwear comfort is primarily determined by the fit between the foot and the shoe. Foot deformations that cannot be accommodated by the flexibility of the material of the shoe upper have to be dealt with by other adaptive means. The major purpose of this study was to determine foot deformations using nine foot dimensions-foot length, arch length, foot width, midfoot width, heel width, midfoot height, medial malleolus height of the most protruding point, lateral malleolus height of the most protruding point and ball girth-as well as the eversion/inversion of the foot while bearing weight. Each foot of 30 Hong Kong Chinese adults (15 males and 15 females) was laser scanned under the conditions of no body-weight (NWB), half body-weight (HWB) and full body-weight (FWB). The nine dimensions and foot rotation were determined with a computer program. The results show that the foot became significantly longer, wider, and reduced in height while everting with increased loading on the foot. The midfoot had relatively large changes in width and height when compared to the forefoot and rearfoot. Even though there were no obvious patterns between the left and right foot for both males and females, considerable differences did exist between the two feet of a few participants. Foot length as a percentage of stature changed from 14.94{\%} to 15.10{\%} to 15.13{\%} in males as the load on the foot increased from NWB to HWB to FWB, respectively. These percentages were 14.56{\%}, 14.72{\%}, and 14.77{\%} for females. Even though foot width was significantly correlated with the body weight of males, no such relationship exists in Hong Kong females. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Anthropological Society of Nippon.},

abstract = {The complex functions of feet require a specific composition, which is progressively achieved by developmental processes. This development should take place without being affected by footwear. The aim of this study is to evaluate differences between static and dynamic foot morphology in developing feet. Feet of 2554 participants (6-16 years) were recorded using a new scanner system (DynaScan4D). Each foot was recorded in static half and full weight-bearing and during walking. Several foot measures corresponding to those used in last construction were calculated. The differences were identified by one-way ANOVA and paired Student's t-test. Static and dynamic values of each foot measure must be considered to improve the fit of footwear. In particular, footwear must account for the increase of forefoot width and the decrease of midfoot girth. Furthermore, the toe box should have a more rounded shape. The findings are important for the construction of footwear for developing feet. Practitioner Summary: Until now, foot deformation has not been analysed in developing feet. The presented differences between standing and walking of 2554 children were obtained using a new dynamic 3D scanner system. The results show that especially differences between foot width and girth measures and angles must be considered in footwear construction. {\textcopyright} 2014 {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of the present study is to identify influences of gender, age, and body mass on the dynamic foot morphology and foot deformation of maturing feet. Only advancements in scanner technology enable recording of foot morphology during walking.Methods: Static and dynamic foot morphology of 2554 participants (6-16 years) were measured with DynaScan4D. Different foot measures corresponding to measures used in last construction were defined. Influences of gender, age, and body mass were calculated within the whole sample by multiple linear regression analysis and within matched groups by Student's t-test.Results: The results of multiple linear regression analysis show similar patterns in boys and girls. The explained variance (R2) of the differences between static and dynamic foot morphology is low. R2 is higher for the maximum dynamic foot measures where the respective static value mainly predicts the dynamic value. Relative maximum dynamic values of foot height, width, and girth are higher in overweight, younger, and male participants. The deformation of the instep height and the angle of the fifth toe differ between overweight and normal weight participants. Between boys and girls as well as children and adolescents there are differences in the deformation of the ball area.Conclusion: There are effects of gender, age, and body mass on dynamic foot morphology and deformation. The differences are small regarding the high variability. Thus, dynamic adjustments are applicable without customising to gender, age, and body mass. However, it is important to account for the high variability and for static and dynamic situations. This should be discussed with focus on use of resilient materials. These results can improve footwear design and thus contribute to healthy foot development. {\textcopyright} 2013 {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Purpose: To analyze gender differences in foot shape in a large sample of young individuals. Methods: Univariate t-tests and multivariate discriminant analyses were used to assess 1) significant differences between men and women for each foot and leg dimension, standardized to foot length, 2) the reliability of classification into gender classes using the absolute and standardized variable sets, and 3) the relative importance of each variable to the discrimination between men and women. Results: Men have longer and broader feet than women for a given stature. After normalization of the measurements by foot length, men and women were found to differ significantly in two calf, five ankle, and four foot shape variables. Classification by gender using absolute values was correct at least 93{\%} of the time. Using the variables standardized to foot length, gender was correctly classified 85{\%} of the time. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that female feet and legs are not simply scaled-down versions of male feet but rather differ in a number of shape characteristics, particularly at the arch, the lateral side of the foot, the first toe, and the ball of the foot. These differences should be taken into account in the design and manufacture of women's sport shoes.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to investigate sex-related differences in foot morphology. In total, 847 subjects were scanned using a 3-D-footscanner. Three different analysis methods were used: (1) comparisons were made for absolute foot measures within 250-270 mm foot length (FL); (2) and for averaged measures ({\%} FL) across all sizes; (3) the feet were then classified using a cluster analysis. Within 250-270 mm FL, male feet were wider and higher (mean differences (MD) 1.3-5.9 mm). No relevant sex-related differences could be found in the comparison of averaged measures (MD 0.3-0.6{\%} FL). Foot types were categorised into voluminous, flat-pointed and slender. Shorter feet were more often voluminous, longer feet were more likely to be narrow and flat. However, the definition of 'short' and 'long' was sex-related; thus, allometry of foot measures was different. For shoe design, measures should be derived for each size and sex separately. Different foot types should be considered to account for the variety in foot shape. Improper footwear can cause foot pain and deformity. Therefore, knowledge of sex-related differences in foot measures is important to assist proper shoe fit in both men and women. The present study supplements the field of knowledge within this context with recommendations for the manufacturing of shoes.},

Four hundred twenty-four feet and four men's running shoe lasts (U.S. women 6.0-9.5), which also are used for the manufacturing of women's shoes, were scanned in three dimensions. Six foot measures were quantified. Different foot types were classified using a cluster analysis. Comparisons were made between last measures and averaged as well as foot type specific foot measures. Differences in width measures between lasts and foot types vary substantially (0-9 mm). Length grading is similar for lasts and feet (differences {\textless} 1mm). Width grading is larger in lasts in comparison with average grading in feet (3.5-5.9 mm). Last design and grading should account for the sex-specific allometry in foot measures. The use of down-graded men's lasts for women's shoes has to be questioned. Therefore, sex-specific reference measures and wear tests should incorporate different foot types in different sizes to allow suitable implications for a proper design and grading of lasts.

abstract = {Objective This study has assessed age-related changes of foot morphology for developing appropriate footwear with particular reference to the elderly.
Methods Anatomical parameters such as foot length, circumference and height and ankle length, circumference and height were assessed in a sample of males (n = 577) and females (n = 528) divided into three age groups. The groups included young-adult, aged between 20 and 25 years; adult, aged between 35 and 55 years; and old, aged between 65 and 70 years individuals.
Results In terms of gender differences, in young-adult individuals the sex-related morphological differences observed, are just related to a significantly lower length of foot in females. In adult subjects morphological parameters investigated were significantly lower in females even after normalization for foot length. In old individuals, no differences of the parameters were found after normalization for foot length. Comparative analysis of morphometric data between young-adult and adult individuals revealed that the instep length was smaller in adults. The opposite was observed for the great toe and medial foot arch height. Length of ankle was higher in adult than in young-adult individuals, whereas ankle circumference and height were smaller. In old vs adult individuals foot circumference showed the most relevant age-related differences.
Conclusions Feet anatomy presents specific characteristics in different ages of life. The ideal footwear should take into account these characteristics. This is true primarily for the elderly for minimizing the risk of falls or of other problems related to inappropriate footwear.},

abstract = {Background Overweight and obesity are increasing in prevalence. However, despite reports of poor foot health, the influence of obesity and overweight on adult foot morphology has received limited attention. The objective of this work is to accurately and appropriately quantify the foot morphology of adults who are overweight and obese. Methods The foot morphology of 23 healthy weight (BMI = 22.9 kg.m− 2), overweight (27.5 kg.m− 2) and obese (32.9 kg.m− 2) age (60 years) matched males was quantified using a 3D scanner (all size UK 9). Data analysis computed normalised (to foot length) standard anatomical measures, and widths, heights and circumferences of 31 evenly spaced cross-sections of right feet. Findings Anatomical measures of foot, ball and heel width, ball and heel circumference and ball height were all greater in the obese group than the healthy weight (P {\textless} 0.05). Cross-sectional measures were significantly wider than the healthy group for the majority of measures from 14 to 67{\%} (P = 0.025–1.000) of heel-to-toe length. Also, the obese group had significantly higher midfoot regions (P = 0.024–0.025). This increased foot height was not evident from anatomical measures, which were not sensitive enough to detect dimensional differences in this foot region. Interpretation Feet of obese adults differ from healthy and overweight individuals, notably they are wider. Data needs to avoid reliance upon discrete anatomical landmarks to describe foot morphology. In the obese, changes in foot shape do not coincide with traditional anatomical landmarks and more comprehensive foot shape data are required to inform footwear design.},

Although underground coal miners report the fit of their work boots as reasonable to good, they frequently rate their boots as uncomfortable, suggesting that there is a mismatch between the shape of their feet and their boots. This study aimed to identify whether dimensions derived from the three-dimensional scans of 208 underground coal miners' feet (age 38.3 ± 9.8 years) differed from the internal dimensions of their work boots. The results revealed underground coal miners wore boots that were substantially longer than their feet, possibly because boots available in their correct length were too narrow. It is recommended boot manufacturers reassess the algorithms used to create boot lasts, focusing on adjusting boot circumference at the instep and heel relative to increases in foot length. Practitioner Summary: Fit and comfort ratings suggest a mismatch between the shape of underground coal miners' feet and their boots exists. This study examined whether three-dimensional scans of 208 miners' feet differed from their boot internal dimensions. Miners wore boots substantially longer than their feet, possibly due to inadequate width.},

abstract = {Footwear comfort is an important factor in design, purchase and use of running shoes but current measures require multiple subjective assessments. Therefore, an objective and more reliable surrogate measure of footwear comfort would be of high relevance. In other research fields, perceived comfort was found to influence the variability of movement execution. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of perceived footwear comfort on the variability of running kinematics as a potential surrogate measure of comfort. Thirty-six recreational athletes ran in five different running shoes on an indoor track while their running kinematics were recorded using a foot-mounted tri-axial inertial measurement unit (IMU). Footwear comfort was measured through multiple subjective assessments. The relative variability of IMU data was determined across the swing phase of 45 gait cycles and compared between the most and least comfortable shoes. Lower footwear comfort was associated with lower kinematic variability especially in the second half of the swing phase but only for variables that are not directly linked to the forward propulsion during running and mainly describe frontal and transverse joint rotations. The constraints of an uncomfortable shoe may lead to the adaptation of a more monotonous running style with the goal to stay in the least uncomfortable movement path. This finding may partially explain a previously described higher injury risk when exercising in footwear of lower comfort, as more repetitive forces could increase the risk of overuse injury. The results of this study implicate the possible use of IMU-based kinematic variability as a surrogate measure of footwear comfort, which could complement subjective measures.},

abstract = {Objective: The shape of the current physical and computational surrogates of children used for restraint system assessments is based largely on standard anthropometric dimensions. These scalar dimensions provide valuable information on the overall size of the individual but do not provide good guidance on shape or posture. This study introduced the development of a parametric model that statistically predicts individual child body shapes in seated postures with a few given parameters. Methods: Surface geometry data from a laser scanner of children ages 3 to 11 (n = 135) were standardized by a 2-level fitting method using intermediate templates. The standardized data were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) to efficiently describe the body shape variance. Parameters such as stature, body mass index, erect sitting height, and 2 posture variables related to torso recline and lumbar spine flexion were associated with the PCA model using regression. Results: When the original scan data were compared with the predictions of the model using the given subject dimensions, the average root mean square error for the torso was 9.5 mm, and the 95th percentile error was 17.35 mm. Conclusions: For the first time, a statistical model of child body shapes in seated postures is available. This parametric model allows the generation of an infinite number of virtual children spanning a wide range of body sizes and postures. The results have broad applicability in product design and safety analysis. Future work is needed to improve the representation of hands and feet and to extend the age range of the model. The model presented in this article is publicly available online through HumanShape.org.},

abstract = {Human figure models included with today's high-end simulation systems are widely used for ergonomic analysis. Male and female figures can be scaled by inputting standard anthropometric dimensions, such as stature, body weight, and limb lengths to represent a large range of body sizes. However, the shapes of these scaled figures are often unrealistic, particularly for extreme body types, because only a relatively few dimensions of the figures are adjusted. Several software packages have the capability of adjusting the figure to match a body surface scan of an individual, but this capability is insufficient when individuals with a wide range of attributes must be simulated. We present a new figure generation capability in the Jack human modeling software based on a statistical analysis of laser scans of hundreds of men and women. A template mesh based on the Jack figure model was fitted to each scan, and a statistical shape model was created using principal component analysis and regression. The model was integrated within the Jack software to create Jack figures with highly realistic body shapes, usable natively with all simulation and analysis features.},

We formulate an optimization problem in which the degrees of freedom are an affine transformation at each template vertex. The objective function is a weighted combination of three measures: proximity of transformed vertices to the range data, similarity between neighboring transformations, and proximity of sparse markers at corresponding locations on the template and target surface. We solve for the transformations with a non-linear optimizer, run at two resolutions to speed convergence. We demonstrate reconstruction and consistent parameterization of 250 human body models. With this parameterized set, we explore a variety of applications for human body modeling, including: morphing, texture transfer, statistical analysis of shape, model fitting from sparse markers, feature analysis to modify multiple correlated parameters (such as the weight and height of an individual), and transfer of surface detail and animation controls from a template to fitted models. {\textcopyright} 2003 ACM.},

abstract = {We introduce the SCAPE method (Shape Completion and Animation for PEople) - a data-driven method for building a human shape model that spans variation in both subject shape and pose. The method is based on a representation that incorporates both articulated and non-rigid deformations. We learn a pose deformation model that derives the non-rigid surface deformation as a function of the pose of the articulated skeleton. We also learn a separate model of variation based on body shape. Our two models can be combined to produce 3D surface models with realistic muscle deformation for different people in different poses, when neither appear in the training set. We show how the model can be used for shape completion - generating a complete surface mesh given a limited set of markers specifying the target shape. We present applications of shape completion to partial view completion and motion capture animation. In particular, our method is capable of constructing a high-quality animated surface model of a moving person, with realistic muscle deformation, using just a single static scan and a marker motion capture sequence of the person.

@article{Riebe2015,
abstract = {The purpose of the American College of Sports Medicine's (ACSM) exercise preparticipation health screening process is to identify individuals who may be at elevated risk for exercise-related sudden cardiac death and/or acute myocardial infarction. Recent studies have suggested that using the current ACSM exercise preparticipation health screening guidelines can result in excessive physician referrals, possibly creating a barrier to exercise participation. In addition, there is considerable evidence that exercise is safe for most people and has many associated health and fitness benefits; exercise-related cardiovascular events are often preceded by warning signs/symptoms; and the cardiovascular risks associated with exercise lessen as individuals become more physically active/fit. Consequently, a scientific roundtable was convened by the ACSM in June 2014 to evaluate the current exercise preparticipation health screening recommendations. The roundtable proposed a new evidence-informed model for exercise preparticipation health screening on the basis of three factors: 1) the individual's current level of physical activity, 2) presence of signs or symptoms and/or known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease, and 3) desired exercise intensity, as these variables have been identified as risk modulators of exercise-related cardiovascular events. Identifying cardiovascular disease risk factors remains an important objective of overall disease prevention and management, but risk factor profiling is no longer included in the exercise preparticipation health screening process. The new ACSM exercise preparticipation health screening recommendations reduce possible unnecessary barriers to adopting and maintaining a regular exercise program, a lifestyle of habitual physical activity, or both, and thereby emphasize the important public health message that regular physical activity is important for all individuals.},

abstract = {The ideal means of achieving perfect fit is to produce individual, tailor-made shoes. However, this method is expensive and unaffordable for most people. At the opposite end of the scale, companies would prefer to be able to make shoes in only very few sizes, but this would lead to poor fit for the majority of customers. Many sizes of shoe are therefore required to meet consumer requirements while still ensuring that the business is profitable. The exact number of sizes is decided according to the costs of production and raw materials, as well as the fitting requirements, while the sizes themselves are determined principally on the basis of shoe-last sizes. This chapter introduces the sizing of shoe lasts, and consequently also footwear, as well as grading, a process used to modify the standard shoe last to create different sizes. A number of different standard systems for sizing and grading are used worldwide; this chapter compares the differences among the systems and discusses new research on sizing and grading.},

abstract = {Introduction: Musculoskeletal models are important tools for studying movement patterns, tissue loading, and neuromechanics. Personalising bone anatomy within models improves analysis accuracy. Few studies have focused on personalising foot bone anatomy, potentially incorrectly estimating the foot's contribution to locomotion. Statistical shape models have been created for a subset of foot-ankle bones, but have not been validated. This study aimed to develop and validate statistical shape models of the functional segments in the foot: first metatarsal, midfoot (second-to-fifth metatarsals, cuneiforms, cuboid, and navicular), calcaneus, and talus; then, to assess reconstruction accuracy of these shape models using sparse anatomical data. Methods: Magnetic resonance images of 24 individuals feet (age = 28 ± 6 years, 52{\%} female, height = 1.73 ± 0.8 m, mass = 66.6 ± 13.8 kg) were manually segmented to generate three-dimensional point clouds. Point clouds were registered and analysed using principal component analysis. For each bone segment, a statistical shape model and principal components were created, describing population shape variation. Statistical shape models were validated by assessing reconstruction accuracy in a leave-one-out cross validation. Statistical shape models were created by excluding a participant's bone segment and used to reconstruct that same excluded bone using full segmentations and sparse anatomical data (i.e. three discrete points on each segment), for all combinations in the dataset. Tali were not reconstructed using sparse anatomical data due to a lack of externally accessible landmarks. Reconstruction accuracy was assessed using Jaccard index, root mean square error (mm), and Hausdorff distance (mm). Results: Reconstructions generated using full segmentations had mean Jaccard indices between 0.77 ± 0.04 and 0.89 ± 0.02, mean root mean square errors between 0.88 ± 0.19 and 1.17 ± 0.18 mm, and mean Hausdorff distances between 2.99 ± 0.98 mm and 6.63 ± 3.68 mm. Reconstructions generated using sparse anatomical data had mean Jaccard indices between 0.67 ± 0.06 and 0.83 ± 0.05, mean root mean square error between 1.21 ± 0.54 mm and 1.66 ± 0.41 mm, and mean Hausdorff distances between 3.21 ± 0.94 mm and 7.19 ± 3.54 mm. Jaccard index was higher (P {\textless} 0.01) and root mean square error was lower (P {\textless} 0.01) in reconstructions from full segmentations compared to sparse anatomical data. Hausdorff distance was lower (P {\textless} 0.01) for midfoot and calcaneus reconstructions using full segmentations compared to sparse anatomical data. Conclusion: For the first time, statistical shape models of the primary functional segments of the foot were developed and validated. Foot segments can be reconstructed with minimal error using full segmentations and sparse anatomical landmarks. In future, larger training datasets could increase statistical shape model robustness, extending use to paediatric or pathological populations.},

@article{Scott1993,
abstract = {A model of the human foot is proposed in which the foot is represented as eight rigid segments and eight monocentric, single-degree-of-freedom joints. The soft tissue under the foot is divided into seven independent sites of contact, or loading, and each of these is modelled as a nonlinear spring and a nonlinear damper in-parallel. The model was used to estimate the kinematics and kinetics of the foot during the stance phase of walking. The force sustained at each loading site was calculated from walking trials in which only portions of the foot landed on a small force platform. The position of the calcaneus was defined by surface markers, whereas the position of the distal segments were based upon chalk footprints and an estimate of the compression of the plantar soft tissue. The results suggest that the joints that constitute the longitudinal arch extend slightly when the forefoot is loaded. During push-off, these joints flex as the metatarsophalangeal joints extend. Similar kinematic results were estimated when the distal segments of the foot were defined by surface markers. The magnitude of the joint moments of force depended largely on the distribution of the load under the foot which varied considerably between subjects. The stable, yet resilient properties of the foot, as highlighted by this model, should be considered in three-dimensional dynamic models used to study human locomotion. The model provides an objective tool to quantify foot motion and loading, which may prove useful for describing foot function in normal and pathological conditions. {\textcopyright} 1993 Pergamon Press Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new protocol designed to track a large number of foot segments during the stance phase of gait with the smallest possible number of markers, with particular clinical focus on coronal plane alignment of the rear-foot, transverse and sagittal plane alignment of the metatarsal bones, and changes at the medial longitudinal arch. The shank, calcaneus, mid-foot and metatarsus were assumed to be 3D rigid bodies. The longitudinal axis of the first, second and fifth metatarsal bones and the proximal phalanx of the hallux were also tracked independently. Skin markers were mounted on bony prominences or joint lines, avoiding the course of main tendons. Trajectories of the 14 markers were collected by an eight-camera motion capture system at 100 Hz on a population of 10 young volunteers. Three-dimensional joint rotations and planar angles were calculated according to anatomically based reference frames. The marker set was well visible throughout the stance phase of gait, even in a camera configuration typical of gait analysis of the full body. The time-histories of the joint rotations and planar angles were well repeatable among subjects and consistent with clinical and biomechanical knowledge. Several dynamic measurements were originally taken, such as elevation/drop of the medial longitudinal arch and of three metatarsal bones, rear-foot to fore-foot rotation and transverse plane deformation of the metatarsus. The information obtained from this protocol, consistent with previous clinical knowledge, enhanced our understanding of the dynamics of the human foot during stance. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A novel three-dimensional numerical model of the foot, incorporating, for the first time in the literature, realistic geometric and material properties of both skeletal and soft tissue components of the foot, was developed for biomechanical analysis of its structural behavior during gait. A system of experimental methods, integrating the optical Contact Pressure Display (CPD) method for plantar pressure measurements and a Digital Radiographic Fluoroscopy (DRF) instrument for acquisition of skeletal motion during gait, was also developed in this study and subsequently used to build the foot model and validate its predictions. Using a Finite Element solver, the stress distribution within the foot structure was obtained and regions of elevated stresses for six subphases of the stance (initial-contact, heel-strike, midstance, forefoot-contact, push-off, and toe-off) were located. For each of these subphases, the model was adapted according to the corresponding fluoroscopic data, skeletal dynamics, and active muscle force loading. Validation of the stress state was achieved by comparing model predictions of contact stress distribution with respective CPD measurements. The presently developed measurement and numerical analysis tools open new approaches for clinical applications, from simulation of the development mechanisms of common foot disorders to pre- and post-interventional evaluation of their treatment.},

abstract = {Functional units in the human foot provide a meaningful basis for subdivisions of the entire foot during gait analysis as well as justified simplifications of foot models. The present study aimed to identify such functional units during walking and slow running. An invasive method based upon reflective marker arrays mounted on intracortical pins was used to register motion of seven foot bones. Six healthy subjects were assessed during walking and four of them during slow running. Angle-angle diagrams of corresponding planar bone rotations were plotted against each other and used to establish functional units. Individual functional units were accepted when the joints rotated temporally in phase and either (i) in the same direction, (ii) in the opposite direction, or (iii) when one of the two joints showed no rotation. A functional unit was generalized if all available angle-angle diagrams showed a consistent pattern. A medial array from the navicular to the first metatarsal was found to perform as a functional unit with parts rotating in the same direction and larger rotations occurring proximally. A rigid functional unit comprised the navicular and cuboid. No other functional units were identified. It was concluded that the talus, navicular, and medial cuneiform should neither be regarded as one rigid unit nor as one segment during gait analysis. The first and fifth metatarsals should also be considered separately. It was further concluded that a marker setup for gait analysis should consist of the following four segments: calcaneus, navicular-cuboid, medial cuneiform-first metatarsal, fifth metatarsal. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Movement between the talus and the tibia showed the expected predominance of sagittal plane motion, but the talocalcaneal joint displayed greater variability than expected in its motion. Movement at the talonavicular joint was greater than at the talocalcaneal joint and motion between the medial cuneiform and navicular was far greater than expected.

abstract = {Multi-segmental foot kinematics have been analyzed by means of optical marker-sets or by means of inertial sensors, but never by markerless dynamic 3D scanning (D3DScanning). The use of D3DScans implies a radically different approach for the construction of the multi-segment foot model: the foot anatomy is identified via the surface shape instead of distinct landmark points. We propose a 4-segment foot model consisting of the shank (Sha), calcaneus (Cal), metatarsus (Met) and hallux (Hal). These segments are manually selected on a static scan. To track the segments in the dynamic scan, the segments of the static scan are matched on each frame of the dynamic scan using the iterative closest point (ICP) fitting algorithm. Joint rotations are calculated between Sha-Cal, Cal-Met, and Met-Hal. Due to the lower quality scans at heel strike and toe off, the first and last 10{\%} of the stance phase is excluded. The application of the method to 5 healthy subjects, 6 trials each, shows a good repeatability (intra-subject standard deviations between 1° and 2.5°) for Sha-Cal and Cal-Met joints, and inferior results for the Met-Hal joint ({\textgreater}3°). The repeatability seems to be subject-dependent. For the validation, a qualitative comparison with joint kinematics from a corresponding established marker-based multi-segment foot model is made. This shows very consistent patterns of rotation. The ease of subject preparation and also the effective and easy to interpret visual output, make the present technique very attractive for functional analysis of the foot, enhancing usability in clinical practice. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

The integration of 3D scanning technology into footwear retail stores has made it possible for this research to analyze a database containing a large number of male and female 3D foot scans collected across North America, Europe, and Asia. Foot scans were classified into length classes with 5mm length increments; mean width, instep height, and heel width were calculated for each length class. This study confirms the existence of many statistically significant differences in mean foot measurements amongst the regions and between the sexes, and a large dispersion of foot measurements within each group of customers. Therefore, shoes should be developed separately for each group, region, and sex, and at least 3 shoe widths per length class are required to provide a proper fit for 90{\%} of customers. Beyond this, our analysis asserts that a shoe designed for a single group will fit a different segment of the population in another group, and that existing last grading tables should be updated to reflect the foot dimensions of current consumers.},

@article{Farris2019,
abstract = {Human feet have evolved to facilitate bipedal locomotion, losing an opposable digit that grasped branches in favor of a longitudinal arch (LA) that stiffens the foot and aids bipedal gait. Passive elastic structures are credited with supporting the LA, but recent evidence suggests that plantar intrinsic muscles (PIMs) within the foot actively contribute to foot stiffness. To test the functional significance of the PIMs, we compared foot and lower limb mechanics with and without a tibial nerve block that prevented contraction of these muscles. Comparisons were made during controlled limb loading, walking, and running in healthy humans. An inability to activate the PIMs caused slightly greater compression of the LA when controlled loads were applied to the lower limb by a linear actuator. However, when greater loads were experienced during ground contact in walking and running, the stiffness of the LA was not altered by the block, indicating that the PIMs' contribution to LA stiffness is minimal, probably because of their small size. With the PIMs blocked, the distal joints of the foot could not be stiffened sufficiently to provide normal push-off against the ground during late stance. This led to an increase in stride rate and compensatory power generated by the hip musculature, but no increase in the metabolic cost of transport. The results reveal that the PIMs have a minimal effect on the stiffness of the LA when absorbing high loads, but help stiffen the distal foot to aid push-off against the ground when walking or running bipedally.},

abstract = {Despite the fact that a number of studies have investigated lower extremity energy generation during locomotion, the influence of the metatarsophalangeal (MP) joint remained unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative contribution of the MP joint to the total mechanical energy in running and sprinting. A sagittal plane analysis was performed on data collected from 10 trained male athletes (five runners and five sprinters). The MP moment was assumed to be negligible until the ground reaction force acted distal to the joint. During running, once the ground reaction force crossed the MP joint, the MP moment was plantarflexor for the remainder of ground contact with average peak values of 59.9 Nm. The MP joint moment was plantarflexor throughout the stance phase for sprinting with average peak values of 112.4 Nm. Since the MP joint was dorsiflexing throughout the majority of the stance phase the joint absorbed large amounts of energy, on average 20.9 J during running and 47.8 J during sprinting. A lack of plantarflexion of the MP joint resulted in a lack of energy generation during take-off. Thus, the energy that was absorbed at the joint was dissipated in the shoe and foot structures.},

abstract = {Outdoor activities are a popular form of recreation, with hiking being the most popular outdoor activity as well as being the most prevalent in terms of injury. Over the duration of a hike, trekkers will encounter many different sloped terrains. Not much is known about the required traction or foot-floor kinematics during locomotion on these sloped surfaces, therefore, the purpose was to determine the three-dimensional foot-floor kinematics and required traction during level, downhill, uphill and cross-slope walking. Ten participants performed level, uphill, downhill and cross-slope walking along a 19° inclined walkway. Ground reaction force data as well as 3D positions of retro reflective markers attached to the shoe were recorded using a Motion Analysis System. Peak traction coefficients and foot-floor kinematics during sloped walking were compared to level walking. When walking along different sloped surfaces, the required traction coefficients at touchdown were not different from level walking, therefore, the increased likelihood of heel slipping during hiking is potentially due to the presence of loose material (rocks, dirt) on hiking slopes, rather than the overall lack of traction. Differences in required traction were seen at takeoff, with uphill and cross-sloped walking requiring a greater amount of traction compared to level walking. Changes in sagittal plane, frontal plane and transverse plane foot-floor angles were seen while walking on the sloped surfaces. Rapid foot-floor eversion was observed during cross-slope walking which could place the hiker at risk of injury with a misstep or if there was a slight slip. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Walking on uneven terrain is more energetically costly than walking on smooth ground, but the biomechanical factors that contribute to this increase are unknown. To identify possible factors, we constructed an uneven terrain treadmill that allowed us to record biomechanical, electromyographic and metabolic energetics data from human subjects. We hypothesized that walking on uneven terrain would increase step width and length variability, joint mechanical work and muscle co-activation compared with walking on smooth terrain. We tested healthy subjects (N=11) walking at 1.0 m s-1, and found that, when walking on uneven terrain with up to 2.5 cm variation, subjects decreased their step length by 4{\%} and did not significantly change their step width, while both step length and width variability increased significantly (22 and 36{\%}, respectively; P{\textless}0.05). Uneven terrain walking caused a 28 and 62{\%} increase in positive knee and hip work, respectively, and a 26{\%} greater magnitude of negative knee work (0.0106, 0.1078 and 0.0425 J kg-1, respectively; P{\textless}0.05). Mean muscle activity increased in seven muscles in the lower leg and thigh (P{\textless}0.05). These changes caused overall net metabolic energy expenditure to increase by 0.73 W kg-1 (28{\%}; P{\textless}0.0001). Much of that increase could be explained by the increased mechanical work observed at the knee and hip. Greater muscle co-activation could also contribute to increased energetic cost but to unknown degree. The findings provide insight into how lower limb muscles are used differently for natural terrain compared with laboratory conditions. {\textcopyright}2013.

The ability of the dynamic and static stabilizers of the ankle joint to maintain their structural integrity is a major component of the normal gait cycle. In sports, this quality assumes even greater importance given the range of movement and stresses imposed on the ankle during various sporting disciplines. In the general population, the Incidence of ankle sprain is very high. In several studies, injuries to the lateral ankle ligaments have been shown to be the most common sports-related injuries, accounting for approximately 25{\%} of all sports-related injuries. Furthermore, up to 80{\%} of all ankle sprains involve the lateral ligament complex. Other studies have estimated their incidence as approximately 5000 injuries per day in the United Kingdom and 23 000 in the United States. Aggressive treatment of the sprained ankle is essential to maintain foot and ankle mobility and prevent prolonged disability and subsequent overuse injuries among athletes, both professional and "weekend warriors" alike. {\textcopyright}The Physician and Sportsmedicine.},

abstract = {Increased boot shaft stiffness may have a noticeable impact on the range of motion of the ankle joint. Therefore, the ability of the ankle joint to generate power for propulsion might be impaired. This might result in compensatory changes at the knee and hip joint. Besides, adaptability of the subtalar joint to uneven surface might be reduced, which could in turn affect stability. The aim of the study was therefore to investigate the influence of boot shaft stiffness on biomechanical gait parameters.Fifteen healthy young adults walked over coarse gravel wearing two different hiking boots that differed by 50{\%} in passive shaft stiffness. Leg kinematics, kinetics and electromyography were measured. Gait velocity and indicators for stability were not different when walking with the hard and soft boot shaft over the gravel surface. However, the hard boot shaft decreased the ankle range of motion as well as the eccentric energy absorbed at the ankle joint. As a consequence, compensatory changes at the knee joint were observed. Co-contraction was increased, and greater eccentric energy was absorbed. Therefore, the efficiency of gait with hard boots might be decreased and joint loading at the knee might be increased, which might cause early fatigue of knee muscles during walking or hiking. The results of this study suggest that stiffness and blocking of joint motion at the ankle should not be equated with safety. A trade-off between lateral stiffness and free natural motion of the ankle joint complex might be preferable. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The modern human foot is the culmination of more than five million years of evolution. The ankle-foot complex absorbs forces during loading, accommodates uneven surfaces, and acts as a lever for efficient propulsion. The ankle-foot complex has six independent functional segments that should be understood for proper assessment and treatment of foot and ankle injuries: the shank, rearfoot, midfoot, lateral forefoot, and the medial forefoot. The compliance of the individual segments of the foot is dependent on velocity, task, and active and passive coupling mechanisms within each of the foot segments. It is also important to understand the passive, active, and neural subsystems that are functionally intertwined to provide structure and control to the multisegmented foot. The purpose of the first part of this clinical commentary and current concepts review was to examine foot and ankle anatomy, detail the roles of the intrinsic and extrinsic foot and ankle musculature from a multisegmented foot perspective, and discuss the biomechanics of the ankle-foot complex during function. The interplay of segmental joint mobility, afferent and efferent sensorimotor function, and movement and stabilization provided by the extrinsic and intrinsic musculature is required to coordinate and execute the complex kinematic movements in the ankle-foot complex during propulsion.

Although shaft stiffness and sole flexibility appear to be boot design features that could influence perceived comfort and plantar pressures, no study has systematically altered these boot design features to truly understand how they affect these parameters. This study aimed to systematically investigate the effect of changes to shaft stiffness and sole flexibility on perceived comfort and plantar pressures when 20 males walked on a simulated gravel coal mining surface under four different work boot conditions. There were no significant effects of shaft stiffness or sole flexibility on perceived comfort. However, shaft stiffness and sole flexibility each significantly affected the plantar pressures generated under the medial midfoot, heel, middle metatarsals and hallux and, in combination, affected plantar pressures generated beneath the lateral midfoot, medial and lateral metatarsals and lesser toes. Participants preferred a boot with a flexible shaft combined with a stiff sole, citing properties such as fit, moveability, walking effort and support to explain why they perceived one boot as more comfortable than another. We therefore recommend that underground coal mining work boots should be designed to incorporate different flexibility and stiffness between the shaft and sole of the boot to optimise foot movement and, in turn, walking efficiency.},

abstract = {Constellation Program missions to the moon and Mars will include as many as 24 hours of EVA per crew member per week, which will involve the performance of exploration, science, construction, and maintenance tasks. The effectiveness and success of these missions is dependent on designing EVA systems and protocols that maximize human performance and efficiency while minimizing health and safety risks for crew members. The Apollo EVA suits performed very well in the short-duration missions for which they were designed. How- ever, the longer-duration missions, more frequent EVAs, and more varied EVA tasks that are anticipated during the CxP will require EVA suits and systems that are more robust than those used during the Apollo Program. Many of the problems that were encountered with the Apollo EVA suits (e.g., limited mobility and dexterity, high and aft center of gravity (CG), and other features requiring significant crew compensation) will need to be corrected or mitigated to optimize EVA objectives. It is critical to understand the effects of EVA system design variables such as suit pressure, weight/mass, CG location, joint ranges of motion, and biomedical monitoring on the ability of astronauts to perform safe, effi- cient, and effective EVAs. To achieve this understanding, the EVA Physiology, Systems, and Performance (EPSP) Project is working with the CxP to develop and execute an integrated human testing program across multiple environments. This program will provide objective data that will enable informed design decisions, thereby ensuring a Constellation EVA system that optimizes crew member health, safety, efficiency, and performance. This report describes the risks to crew health, safety, performance, and efficiency that an inadequate EVA suit system design would bring, and provides the evidence base to substantiate the importance of the risks.},

The Z-2 suit architecture is an evolution of previous EVA suits, namely the ISS EMU, Mark III, Rear Entry I-Suit and Z-1 spacesuits. The suit is a hybrid hard and soft multi-bearing, rear entry spacesuit. The hard upper torso (HUT) is an all-composite structure and includes a 2-bearing rolling convolute shoulder with Vernier sizing mechanism, removable suit port interface plate (SIP), elliptical hemispherical helmet and self-don/doff shoulder harness. The hatch is a hybrid aluminum and composite construction with Apollo style gas connectors, custom water pass-thru, removable hatch cage and interfaces to primary and auxiliary life support feed water bags. The suit includes Z-1 style lower arms with cam brackets for Vernier sizing and government furnished equipment (GFE) Phase VI gloves. The lower torso includes a telescopic waist sizing system, waist bearing, rolling convolute waist joint, hard brief, 2 bearing soft hip thigh, Z-1 style legs with ISS EMU style cam brackets for sizing, and conformal walking boots with ankle bearings. The Z-2 Requirements Verification Plan includes the verification of more than 200 individual requirements. The verification methods include test, analysis, inspection, demonstration or a combination of methods. Examples of unmanned requirements include suit leakage, proof pressure testing, operational life, mass, isometric man-loads, sizing adjustment ranges, internal and external interfaces such as in-suit drink bag, partial pressure relief valve, purge valve, donning stand and ISS Body Restraint Tether (BRT). Examples of manned requirements include verification of anthropometric range, suit self-don/doff, secondary suit exit method, donning stand self-ingress/egress and manned mobility covering eight functional tasks. The eight functional tasks include kneeling with object pick-up, standing toe touch, cross-body reach, walking, reach to the SIP and helmet visor.},

abstract = {Walking humans conserve mechanical and, presumably, metabolic energy with an inverted pendulum-like exchange of gravitational potential energy and horizontal kinetic energy. Walking in simulated reduced gravity involves a relatively high metabolic cost, suggesting that the inverted-pendulum mechanism is disrupted because of a mismatch of potential and kinetic energy. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the fluctuations and exchange of mechanical energy of the center of mass at different combinations of velocity and simulated reduced gravity. Subjects walked with smaller fluctuations in horizontal velocity in lower gravity, such that the ratio of horizontal kinetic to gravitational potential energy fluctuations remained constant over a fourfold change in gravity. The amount of exchange, or percent recovery, at 1.00 m/s was not significantly different at 1.00, 0.75, and 0.50 G (average 64.4{\%}), although it decreased to 48{\%} at 0.25 G. As a result, the amount of work performed on the center of mass does not explain the relatively high metabolic cost of walking in simulated reduced gravity.},

abstract = {With rising demand on highly accurate acquisition of small motion the use of video-based motion capturing becomes more and more popular. However, the performance of these systems strongly depends on a variety of influencing factors. A method was developed in order to systematically assess accuracy and precision of motion capturing systems with regard to influential system parameters. A calibration and measurement robot was designed to perform a repeatable dynamic calibration and to determine the resultant system accuracy and precision in a control volume investigating small motion magnitudes (180×180×150 mm3). The procedure was exemplified on the Vicon-460 system. Following parameters were analyzed: Camera setup, calibration volume, marker size and lens filter application. Equipped with four cameras the Vicon-460 system provided an overall accuracy of 63±5 $\mu$m and overall precision (noise level) of 15 $\mu$m for the most favorable parameter setting. Arbitrary changes in camera arrangement revealed variations in mean accuracy between 76 and 129 $\mu$m. The noise level normal to the cameras' projection plane was found higher compared to the other coordinate directions. Measurements including regions unaffected by the dynamic calibration reflected considerably lower accuracy (221±79 $\mu$m). Lager marker diameters led to higher accuracy and precision. Accuracy dropped significantly when using an optical lens filter. This study revealed significant influence of the system environment on the performance of video-based motion capturing systems. With careful configuration, optical motion capturing provides a powerful measuring opportunity for the majority of biomechanical applications. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

They are a personalized spacecraft that allows direct contact and interaction with everything beyond our world, and a last refuge for survival in a disaster. Creating safe, reliable, and comfortable spacesuits is an ongoing challenge that has spanned over four decades. "U. S. Spacesuits, 2nd Edition" by Kenneth S. Thomas and Harold J. McMann details the technical evolution of U. S. spacesuits from their roots in high altitude aviation and vacuum tube development to present day, with an additional look into the future. This primary source of spacesuit information explains the functions, historical development, and use of spacesuits from a worldwide perspective. In this new edition, the authors update the story of U.S. spacesuit development and efforts, from the design challenges modern engineers face to the latest roles of spacesuits in space exploration. The book also provides a close up look at NASA's new Constellation Space Suit System as well as Apollo prototype configurations that have been discovered since 2005. Also not in the earlier edition is a prototype and model of the Gemini pressure suit and an explanation of its development. Finally, there are new insights into the suits used for the Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, Space Shuttle, and International Space Station missions.},

abstract = {A detailed understanding of foot morphology can enable the design of more comfortable and better fitting footwear. However, foot morphology varies widely within the population, and changes dynamically during the loading of stance phase. This study presents a parametric statistical shape model from 4D foot scans to capture both the inter- and intra-individual variability in foot morphology. Thirty subjects walked on a treadmill while 4D scans of their right foot were taken at 90 frames-per-second during stance phase. Each subject's height, weight, foot length, foot width, arch length, and sex were also recorded. The 4D scans were all registered to a common high-quality foot scan, and a principal component analysis was done on all processed 4D scans. Elastic-net linear regression models were built to predict the principal component scores, which were then inverse transformed into 4D scans. The best performing model was selected with leave-one-out cross-validation. The chosen model was predicts foot morphology across stance phase with a root-mean squared error of 5.2 +/- 2.0 mm. This study shows that statistical shape modeling can be used to predict dynamic changes in foot morphology across the population. The model can be used to investigate and improve foot-footwear interaction, allowing for better fitting and more comfortable footwear.},

abstract = {Extravehicular Activity (EVA) is a critical component of human spaceflight, but working in gas-pressurized space suits causes fatigue, excessive energy expenditure, and injury. Relatively little is known about how the astronaut moves and interacts with the space suit, and what factors lead to injury. A wearable pressure sensing system to quantitatively measure areas on the body's surface that the space suit impacts during dynamic EVA movement is developed. The system is used to characterize human-suit interaction in the NASA Mark III space suit. Three experienced subjects perform a series of upper body movements: 3 isolated joint movements and 2 functional tasks. Movements are repeated 12 times each and in-suit pressure responses are evaluated both by quantifying peak pressure and full profile responses. Results Sequential sensor activation allows subjects to be indexed inside the space suit during complicated motions to better understand suited biomechanics. Subjectively, subjects generally feel they are consistent for all movements. However, using a nonparametric H-test, 54{\%} of movements are found to be biomechanically inconsistent (p{\textless}0.05). This experiment provides the first "window" inside the space suit to evaluate contact pressures and sequential indexing of the person inside the suit for realistic EVA movement. It cannot be extrapolated how changes in contact pressure would affect a subject's propensity for injury as injuries accumulate over long time scales. However, changes in pressure may be due to alterations in biomechanical strategies or fatigue, both of which could be precursors for injury and discomfort.},

abstract = {Introduction: Shoulder injuries due to working inside the space suit are some of the most serious and debilitating injuries astronauts encounter. Space suit injuries occur primarily in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) underwater training facility due to accumulated musculoskeletal stress. We quantitatively explored the underlying causal mechanisms of injury. Methods: Logistic regression was used to identify relevant space suit components, training environment variables, and anthropometric dimensions related to an increased propensity for space-suited injury. Two groups of subjects were analyzed: those whose reported shoulder incident is attributable to the NBL or working in the space suit, and those whose shoulder incidence began in active duty, meaning working in the suit could be a contributing factor. Results: For both groups, percent of training performed in the space suit planar hard upper torso (HUT) was the most important predictor variable for injury. Frequency of training and recovery between training were also significant metrics. The most relevant anthropometric dimensions were bideltoid breadth, expanded chest depth, and shoulder circumference. Finally, record of previous injury was found to be a relevant predictor for subsequent injury. The first statistical model correctly identifies 39{\%} of injured subjects, while the second model correctly identifies 68{\%} of injured subjects. Discussion: A review of the literature suggests this is the first work to quantitatively evaluate the hypothesized causal mechanisms of all space-suited shoulder injuries. Although limited in predictive capability, each of the identified variables can be monitored and modified operationally to reduce future impacts on an astronaut's health.},

abstract = {Working inside the space suit causes injury and discomfort, but suit assessment techniques such as measuring joint torques and ranges of motion fail to evaluate injury because they fail to distinguish interactions between the human and the space suit. Contact pressure sensing would allow a quantitative assessment of the nature and location of suit-body contact where injuries occur. However, commercially available systems are not well suited for measurement inside the confined environment of the space suit during movement. We report on the design of a wearable pressure sensing system, the Polipo. The Polipo dynamically measures between 5 and 60 kPa of pressure with ∼ 1 kPa sensitivity, is within 10{\%} root mean square error from a known loading profile during dynamic movement, and is a standalone system able to accommodate a 50th percentile female to a 95th percentile male upper body dimensions with near shirt-sleeve mobility. This paper focuses on the upper body, but the methods may be extended to the full body as future work. It provides a pressure sensing system that could be applied beyond the field of aerospace to assess human-garment interactions, for example recommending armor protection for defense applications or to alleviate fall impacts for medical applications.},
